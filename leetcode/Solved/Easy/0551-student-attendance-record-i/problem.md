# 551. Student Attendance Record I

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** String

## Description

You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

 - `'A'`: Absent.
- `'L'`: Late.
- `'P'`: Present.

 The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the following criteria:

 - The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
- The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.

 Return `true`_ if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or _`false`_ otherwise_.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: s = "PPALLP"
Output: true
Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: s = "PPALLL"
Output: false
Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'L'`, or `'P'`.
