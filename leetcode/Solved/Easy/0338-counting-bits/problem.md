# 338. Counting Bits

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation

## Description

Given an integer `n`, return *an array *`ans`* of length *`n + 1`* such that for each *`i`* *(`0 <= i <= n`)*, *`ans[i]`* is the **number of ***`1`***&#39;s** in the binary representation of *`i`.

Do not solve it with built-in functions (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++).
 

Example 1:

```

Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

```

Example 2:

```

Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= n <= 105`

 

**Follow up:**

	- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
