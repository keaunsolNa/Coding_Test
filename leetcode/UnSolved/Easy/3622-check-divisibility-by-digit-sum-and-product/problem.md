# 3622. Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Math

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`. Determine whether `n` is divisible by the **sum **of the following two values:

 - The **digit sum** of `n` (the sum of its digits).
- The **digit** **product** of `n` (the product of its digits).

 Return `true` if `n` is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return `false`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 99

 **Output:** true

 **Explanation:**

 Since 99 is divisible by the sum (9 + 9 = 18) plus product (9 * 9 = 81) of its digits (total 99), the output is true.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 23

 **Output:** false

 **Explanation:**

 Since 23 is not divisible by the sum (2 + 3 = 5) plus product (2 * 3 = 6) of its digits (total 11), the output is false.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 106`
