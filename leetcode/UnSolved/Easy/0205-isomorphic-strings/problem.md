# 205. Isomorphic Strings

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Hash Table, String

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

 Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

 All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"

 **Output:** true

 **Explanation:**

 The strings `s` and `t` can be made identical by:

 - Mapping `'e'` to `'a'`.
- Mapping `'g'` to `'d'`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "f11", t = "b23"

 **Output:** false

 **Explanation:**

 The strings `s` and `t` can not be made identical as `'1'` needs to be mapped to both `'2'` and `'3'`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"

 **Output:** true

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
