# 3038. Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score I

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Simulation

## Description

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Consider the following operation:

 - Delete the first two elements `nums` and define the _score_ of the operation as the sum of these two elements.

 You can perform this operation until `nums` contains fewer than two elements. Additionally, the **same** _score_ must be achieved in **all** operations.

 Return the **maximum** number of operations you can perform.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [3,2,1,4,5]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - We can perform the first operation with the score `3 + 2 = 5`. After this operation, `nums = [1,4,5]`.
- We can perform the second operation as its score is `4 + 1 = 5`, the same as the previous operation. After this operation, `nums = [5]`.
- As there are fewer than two elements, we can't perform more operations.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,5,3,3,4,1,3,2,2,3]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - We can perform the first operation with the score `1 + 5 = 6`. After this operation, `nums = [3,3,4,1,3,2,2,3]`.
- We can perform the second operation as its score is `3 + 3 = 6`, the same as the previous operation. After this operation, `nums = [4,1,3,2,2,3]`.
- We cannot perform the next operation as its score is `4 + 1 = 5`, which is different from the previous scores.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [5,3]

 **Output:** 1

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
