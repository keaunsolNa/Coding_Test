# 3827. Count Monobit Integers

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Bit Manipulation, Enumeration

## Description

You are given an integer `n`.

 An integer is called **Monobit** if all bits in its binary representation are the same.

 Return the count of **Monobit** integers in the range `[0, n]` (inclusive).

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 1

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - The integers in the range `[0, 1]` have binary representations `"0"` and `"1"`.
- Each representation consists of identical bits. Thus, the answer is 2.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 4

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - The integers in the range `[0, 4]` include binaries `"0"`, `"1"`, `"10"`, `"11"`, and `"100"`.
- Only 0, 1 and 3 satisfy the Monobit condition. Thus, the answer is 3.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `0 <= n <= 1000`
