# 993. Cousins in Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree `x` and `y`, return `true` _if the nodes corresponding to the values _`x`_ and _`y`_ in the tree are **cousins**, or _`false`_ otherwise._

 Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.

 Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at the depth `k + 1`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false
```

 **Example 2:**

  ```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
Output: true
```

 **Example 3:**

  ```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
Output: false
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Each node has a **unique** value.
- `x != y`
- `x` and `y` are exist in the tree.
