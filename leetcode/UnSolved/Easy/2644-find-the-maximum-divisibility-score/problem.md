# 2644. Find the Maximum Divisibility Score

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array

## Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `divisors`.

 The **divisibility score** of `divisors[i]` is the number of indices `j` such that `nums[j]` is divisible by `divisors[i]`.

 Return the integer `divisors[i]` with the **maximum** divisibility score. If multiple integers have the maximum score, return the smallest one.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,9,15,50], divisors = [5,3,7,2]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 The divisibility score of `divisors[0]` is 2 since `nums[2]` and `nums[3]` are divisible by 5.

 The divisibility score of `divisors[1]` is 2 since `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` are divisible by 3.

 The divisibility score of `divisors[2]` is 0 since none of the numbers in `nums` is divisible by 7.

 The divisibility score of `divisors[3]` is 2 since `nums[0]` and `nums[3]` are divisible by 2.

 As `divisors[0]`, `divisors[1]`, and `divisors[3]` have the same divisibility score, we return the smaller one which is `divisors[3]`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 The divisibility score of `divisors[0]` is 0 since none of numbers in `nums` is divisible by 5.

 The divisibility score of `divisors[1]` is 1 since only `nums[0]` is divisible by 2.

 The divisibility score of `divisors[2]` is 3 since `nums[2]`, `nums[3]` and `nums[4]` are divisible by 3.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [20,14,21,10], divisors = [10,16,20]

 **Output:** 10

 **Explanation:**

 The divisibility score of `divisors[0]` is 2 since `nums[0]` and `nums[3]` are divisible by 10.

 The divisibility score of `divisors[1]` is 0 since none of the numbers in `nums` is divisible by 16.

 The divisibility score of `divisors[2]` is 1 since `nums[0]` is divisible by 20.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length, divisors.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i], divisors[i] <= 109`
