# 3643. Flip Square Submatrix Vertically

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Two Pointers, Matrix

## Description

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `x`, `y`, and `k`.

 The integers `x` and `y` represent the row and column indices of the **top-left** corner of a **square** submatrix and the integer `k` represents the size (side length) of the square submatrix.

 Your task is to flip the submatrix by reversing the order of its rows vertically.

 Return the updated matrix.

 

 **Example 1:**

   **Input:** grid = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], x = 1, y = 0, k = 3

 **Output:** [[1,2,3,4],[13,14,15,8],[9,10,11,12],[5,6,7,16]]

 **Explanation:**

 The diagram above shows the grid before and after the transformation.

  **Example 2:**

   **Input:** grid = [[3,4,2,3],[2,3,4,2]], x = 0, y = 2, k = 2

 **Output:** [[3,4,4,2],[2,3,2,3]]

 **Explanation:**

 The diagram above shows the grid before and after the transformation.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
- `0 <= x < m`
- `0 <= y < n`
- `1 <= k <= min(m - x, n - y)`
