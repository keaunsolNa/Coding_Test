# 3842. Toggle Light Bulbs

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Sorting, Simulation

## Description

You are given an array `bulbs` of integers between 1 and 100.

 There are 100 light bulbs numbered from 1 to 100. All of them are switched off initially.

 For each element `bulbs[i]` in the array `bulbs`:

 - If the `bulbs[i]th` light bulb is currently off, switch it on.
- Otherwise, switch it off.

 Return the list of integers denoting the light bulbs that are on in the end, **sorted** in **ascending** order. If no bulb is on, return an empty list.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** bulbs = [10,30,20,10]

 **Output:** [20,30]

 **Explanation:**

 - The `bulbs[0] = 10th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
- The `bulbs[1] = 30th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
- The `bulbs[2] = 20th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
- The `bulbs[3] = 10th` light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
- In the end, the 20^th and the 30^th light bulbs are on.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** bulbs = [100,100]

 **Output:** []

 **Explanation:**

 - The `bulbs[0] = 100th` light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
- The `bulbs[1] = 100th` light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
- In the end, no light bulb is on.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= bulbs.length <= 100`
- `1 <= bulbs[i] <= 100`
