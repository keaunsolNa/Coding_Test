# 3884. First Matching Character From Both Ends

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Two Pointers, String

## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters.

 Return the smallest index `i` such that `s[i] == s[n - i - 1]`.

 If no such index exists, return -1.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "abcacbd"

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 At index `i = 1`, `s[1]` and `s[5]` are both `'b'`.

 No smaller index satisfies the condition, so the answer is 1.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "abc"

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 At index `i = 1`, the two compared positions coincide, so both characters are `'b'`.

 No smaller index satisfies the condition, so the answer is 1.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "abcdab"

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 For every index `i`, the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` are different.

 Therefore, no valid index exists, so the answer is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
