# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Prefix Sum

## Description

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.

 You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the **net gain in altitude** between points `i` and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n)`. Return _the **highest altitude** of a point._

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == gain.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`
