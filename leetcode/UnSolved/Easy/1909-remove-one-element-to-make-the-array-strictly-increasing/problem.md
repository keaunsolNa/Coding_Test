# 1909. Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array

## Description

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, return `true` _if it can be made **strictly increasing** after removing **exactly one** element, or _`false`_ otherwise. If the array is already strictly increasing, return _`true`.

 The array `nums` is **strictly increasing** if `nums[i - 1] < nums[i]` for each index `(1 <= i < nums.length).`

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: nums = [1,2,10,5,7]
Output: true
Explanation: By removing 10 at index 2 from nums, it becomes [1,2,5,7].
[1,2,5,7] is strictly increasing, so return true.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation:
[3,1,2] is the result of removing the element at index 0.
[2,1,2] is the result of removing the element at index 1.
[2,3,2] is the result of removing the element at index 2.
[2,3,1] is the result of removing the element at index 3.
No resulting array is strictly increasing, so return false.
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The result of removing any element is [1,1].
[1,1] is not strictly increasing, so return false.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
