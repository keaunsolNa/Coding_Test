# 2806. Account Balance After Rounded Purchase

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Math

## Description

Initially, you have a bank account balance of **100** dollars.

 You are given an integer `purchaseAmount` representing the amount you will spend on a purchase in dollars, in other words, its price.

 When making the purchase, first the `purchaseAmount` **is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10**. Let us call this value `roundedAmount`. Then, `roundedAmount` dollars are removed from your bank account.

 Return an integer denoting your final bank account balance after this purchase.

 **Notes:**

 - 0 is considered to be a multiple of 10 in this problem.
- When rounding, 5 is rounded upward (5 is rounded to 10, 15 is rounded to 20, 25 to 30, and so on).

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** purchaseAmount = 9

 **Output:** 90

 **Explanation:**

 The nearest multiple of 10 to 9 is 10. So your account balance becomes 100 - 10 = 90.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** purchaseAmount = 15

 **Output:** 80

 **Explanation:**

 The nearest multiple of 10 to 15 is 20. So your account balance becomes 100 - 20 = 80.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** purchaseAmount = 10

 **Output:** 90

 **Explanation:**

 10 is a multiple of 10 itself. So your account balance becomes 100 - 10 = 90.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `0 <= purchaseAmount <= 100`
