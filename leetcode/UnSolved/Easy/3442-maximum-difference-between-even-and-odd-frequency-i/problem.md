# 3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Hash Table, String, Counting

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

 Your task is to find the **maximum** difference `diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2)` between the frequency of characters `a1` and `a2` in the string such that:

 - `a1` has an **odd frequency** in the string.
- `a2` has an **even frequency** in the string.

 Return this **maximum** difference.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "aaaaabbc"

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - The character `'a'` has an **odd frequency** of `5`, and `'b'` has an **even frequency** of `2`.
- The maximum difference is `5 - 2 = 3`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "abcabcab"

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 - The character `'a'` has an **odd frequency** of `3`, and `'c'` has an **even frequency** of 2.
- The maximum difference is `3 - 2 = 1`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `3 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `s` contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
