# 2677. Chunk Array

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** 

## Description

Given an array `arr` and a chunk size `size`, return a **chunked** array.

 A **chunked** array contains the original elements in `arr`, but consists of subarrays each of length `size`. The length of the last subarray may be less than `size` if `arr.length` is not evenly divisible by `size`.

 Please solve it without using lodash's `_.chunk` function.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], size = 1
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays each with 1 element.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: arr = [1,9,6,3,2], size = 3
Output: [[1,9,6],[3,2]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays with 3 elements. However, only two elements are left for the 2nd subarray.
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: arr = [8,5,3,2,6], size = 6
Output: [[8,5,3,2,6]]
Explanation: Size is greater than arr.length thus all elements are in the first subarray.
```

 **Example 4:**

 ```
Input: arr = [], size = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no elements to be chunked so an empty array is returned.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `arr` is a string representing the array.
- `2 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `1 <= size <= arr.length + 1`
