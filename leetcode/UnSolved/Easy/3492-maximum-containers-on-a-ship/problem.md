# 3492. Maximum Containers on a Ship

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Math

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n` representing an `n x n` cargo deck on a ship. Each cell on the deck can hold one container with a weight of **exactly** `w`.

 However, the total weight of all containers, if loaded onto the deck, must not exceed the ship's maximum weight capacity, `maxWeight`.

 Return the **maximum** number of containers that can be loaded onto the ship.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 2, w = 3, maxWeight = 15

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation: **

 The deck has 4 cells, and each container weighs 3. The total weight of loading all containers is 12, which does not exceed `maxWeight`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 3, w = 5, maxWeight = 20

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation: **

 The deck has 9 cells, and each container weighs 5. The maximum number of containers that can be loaded without exceeding `maxWeight` is 4.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= w <= 1000`
- `1 <= maxWeight <= 109`
