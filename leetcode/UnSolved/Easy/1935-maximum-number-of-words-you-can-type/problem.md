# 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Hash Table, String

## Description

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

 Given a string `text` of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string `brokenLetters` of all **distinct** letter keys that are broken, return _the **number of words** in_ `text` _you can fully type using this keyboard_.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= text.length <= 104`
- `0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26`
- `text` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
- Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
- `brokenLetters` consists of **distinct** lowercase English letters.
