# 3880. Minimum Absolute Difference Between Two Values

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Enumeration

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting only of 0, 1, and 2.

 A pair of indices `(i, j)` is called **valid** if `nums[i] == 1` and `nums[j] == 2`.

 Return the **minimum** absolute difference between `i` and `j` among all valid pairs. If no valid pair exists, return -1.

 The absolute difference between indices `i` and `j` is defined as `abs(i - j)`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,0,0,2,0,1]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 The valid pairs are:

 - (0, 3) which has absolute difference of `abs(0 - 3) = 3`.
- (5, 3) which has absolute difference of `abs(5 - 3) = 2`.

 Thus, the answer is 2.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,0,1,0]

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 There are no valid pairs in the array, thus the answer is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 2`
