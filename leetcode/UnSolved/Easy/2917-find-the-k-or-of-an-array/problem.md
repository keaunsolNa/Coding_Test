# 2917. Find the K-or of an Array

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Bit Manipulation

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`, and an integer `k`. Let's introduce **K-or** operation by extending the standard bitwise OR. In K-or, a bit position in the result is set to `1` if at least `k` numbers in `nums` have a `1` in that position.

 Return _the K-or of_ `nums`.

 

 **Example 1: **

  **Input:** nums = [7,12,9,8,9,15], k = 4

 **Output:** 9

 **Explanation: **

 Represent numbers in binary:

    **Number** Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0   **7** 0 1 1 1   **12** 1 1 0 0   **9** 1 0 0 1   **8** 1 0 0 0   **9** 1 0 0 1   **15** 1 1 1 1   **Result = 9** 1 0 0 1    Bit 0 is set in 7, 9, 9, and 15. Bit 3 is set in 12, 9, 8, 9, and 15.
 Only bits 0 and 3 qualify. The result is `(1001)2 = 9`.

  **Example 2: **

  **Input:** nums = [2,12,1,11,4,5], k = 6

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation: **No bit appears as 1 in all six array numbers, as required for K-or with `k = 6`. Thus, the result is 0.

  **Example 3: **

  **Input:** nums = [10,8,5,9,11,6,8], k = 1

 **Output:** 15

 **Explanation: ** Since `k == 1`, the 1-or of the array is equal to the bitwise OR of all its elements. Hence, the answer is `10 OR 8 OR 5 OR 9 OR 11 OR 6 OR 8 = 15`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `0 <= nums[i] < 231`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
