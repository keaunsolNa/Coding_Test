# 2481. Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Math, Geometry

## Description

A **valid cut** in a circle can be:

 - A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
- A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.

 Some valid and invalid cuts are shown in the figures below.

  Given the integer `n`, return _the **minimum** number of cuts needed to divide a circle into _`n`_ equal slices_.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The above figure shows how cutting the circle twice through the middle divides it into 4 equal slices.
```

 **Example 2:**

  ```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
At least 3 cuts are needed to divide the circle into 3 equal slices. 
It can be shown that less than 3 cuts cannot result in 3 slices of equal size and shape.
Also note that the first cut will not divide the circle into distinct parts.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 100`
