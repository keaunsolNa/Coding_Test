# 2660. Determine the Winner of a Bowling Game

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Simulation

## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `player1` and `player2`, representing the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.

 The bowling game consists of `n` turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly 10.

 Assume a player hits `xi` pins in the i^th turn. The value of the i^th turn for the player is:

 - `2xi` if the player hits 10 pins **in either (i - 1)^th or (i - 2)^th turn**.
- Otherwise, it is `xi`.

 The **score** of the player is the sum of the values of their `n` turns.

 Return

 - 1 if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,
- 2 if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and
- 0 in case of a draw.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** player1 = [5,10,3,2], player2 = [6,5,7,3]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 The score of player 1 is 5 + 10 + 2*3 + 2*2 = 25.

 The score of player 2 is 6 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 21.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 The score of player 1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.

 The score of player 2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** player1 = [2,3], player2 = [4,1]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 The score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5.

 The score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5.

  **Example 4:**

  **Input:** player1 = [1,1,1,10,10,10,10], player2 = [10,10,10,10,1,1,1]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 The score of player1 is 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 73.

 The score of player2 is 10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 1 = 75.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == player1.length == player2.length`
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= player1[i], player2[i] <= 10`
