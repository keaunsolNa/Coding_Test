# 3774. Absolute Difference Between Maximum and Minimum K Elements

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array, Sorting

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

 Find the absolute difference between:

 - the **sum** of the `k` **largest** elements in the array; and
- the **sum** of the `k` **smallest** elements in the array.

 Return an integer denoting this difference.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [5,2,2,4], k = 2

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 - The `k = 2` largest elements are 4 and 5. Their sum is `4 + 5 = 9`.
- The `k = 2` smallest elements are 2 and 2. Their sum is `2 + 2 = 4`.
- The absolute difference is `abs(9 - 4) = 5`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [100], k = 1

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 - The largest element is 100.
- The smallest element is 100.
- The absolute difference is `abs(100 - 100) = 0`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= n`
