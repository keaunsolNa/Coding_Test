# 3892. Minimum Operations to Achieve At Least K Peaks

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming

## Description

You are given a circular integer array `nums` of length `n`.

 An index `i` is a **peak** if its value is **strictly greater** than its neighbors:

 - The **previous** neighbor of `i` is `nums[i - 1]` if `i > 0`, otherwise `nums[n - 1]`.
- The **next** neighbor of `i` is `nums[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `nums[0]`.

 You are allowed to perform the following operation **any** number of times:

 - Choose any index `i` and **increase** `nums[i]` by 1.

 Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array contain **at least** `k` peaks. If it is impossible, return -1.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,1,2], k = 1

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 - To achieve at least `k = 1` peak, we can increase `nums[2] = 2` to 3.
- After this operation, `nums[2] = 3` is strictly greater than its neighbors `nums[0] = 2` and `nums[1] = 1`.
- Therefore, the minimum number of operations required is 1.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [4,5,3,6], k = 2

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 - The array already contains at least `k = 2` peaks with zero operations.
- Index 1: `nums[1] = 5` is strictly greater than its neighbors `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[2] = 3`.
- Index 3: `nums[3] = 6` is strictly greater than its neighbors `nums[2] = 3` and `nums[0] = 4`.
- Therefore, the minimum number of operations required is 0.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [3,7,3], k = 2

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 It is impossible to have at least `k = 2` peaks in this array. Therefore, the answer is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= n == nums.length <= 5000`
- `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
- `0 <= k <= n`
