# 3213. Construct String with Minimum Cost

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, String, Dynamic Programming, Suffix Array

## Description

You are given a string `target`, an array of strings `words`, and an integer array `costs`, both arrays of the same length.

 Imagine an empty string `s`.

 You can perform the following operation any number of times (including **zero**):

 - Choose an index `i` in the range `[0, words.length - 1]`.
- Append `words[i]` to `s`.
- The cost of operation is `costs[i]`.

 Return the **minimum** cost to make `s` equal to `target`. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** target = "abcdef", words = ["abdef","abc","d","def","ef"], costs = [100,1,1,10,5]

 **Output:** 7

 **Explanation:**

 The minimum cost can be achieved by performing the following operations:

 - Select index 1 and append `"abc"` to `s` at a cost of 1, resulting in `s = "abc"`.
- Select index 2 and append `"d"` to `s` at a cost of 1, resulting in `s = "abcd"`.
- Select index 4 and append `"ef"` to `s` at a cost of 5, resulting in `s = "abcdef"`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** target = "aaaa", words = ["z","zz","zzz"], costs = [1,10,100]

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 It is impossible to make `s` equal to `target`, so we return -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= target.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= words.length == costs.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= target.length`
- The total sum of `words[i].length` is less than or equal to `5 * 104`.
- `target` and `words[i]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 104`
