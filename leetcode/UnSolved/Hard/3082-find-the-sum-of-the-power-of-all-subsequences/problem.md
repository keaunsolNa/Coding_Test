# 3082. Find the Sum of the Power of All Subsequences

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a **positive** integer `k`.

 The **power** of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences with their sum **equal** to `k`.

 Return _the **sum** of **power** of all subsequences of_ `nums`_._

 Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input: **  nums = [1,2,3], k = 3

 **Output: **  6

 **Explanation:**

 There are `5` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

 - The subsequence `[1,2,3]` has `2` subsequences with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]` and `[1,2,3]`.
- The subsequence `[1,2,3]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.
- The subsequence `[1,2,3]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.
- The subsequence `[1,2,3]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.
- The subsequence `[1,2,3]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,3]`.

 Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input: **  nums = [2,3,3], k = 5

 **Output: **  4

 **Explanation:**

 There are `3` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

 - The subsequence `[2,3,3]` has 2 subsequences with `sum == 5`: `[2,3,3]` and `[2,3,3]`.
- The subsequence `[2,3,3]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[2,3,3]`.
- The subsequence `[2,3,3]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[2,3,3]`.

 Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input: **  nums = [1,2,3], k = 7

 **Output: **  0

 **Explanation: **There exists no subsequence with sum `7`. Hence all subsequences of nums have `power = 0`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `1 <= k <= 100`
