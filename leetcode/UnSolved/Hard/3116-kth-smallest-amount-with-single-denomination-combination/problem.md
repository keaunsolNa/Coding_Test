# 3116. Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Math, Binary Search, Bit Manipulation, Combinatorics, Number Theory

## Description

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `k`.

 You have an infinite number of coins of each denomination. However, you are **not allowed** to combine coins of different denominations.

 Return the `kth` **smallest** amount that can be made using these coins.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** coins = [3,6,9], k = 3

 **Output:**  9

 **Explanation:** The given coins can make the following amounts:
 Coin 3 produces multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.
 Coin 6 produces multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.
 Coin 9 produces multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, etc.
 All of the coins combined produce: 3, 6, **9**, 12, 15, etc.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** coins = [5,2], k = 7

 **Output:** 12

 **Explanation:** The given coins can make the following amounts:
 Coin 5 produces multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.
 Coin 2 produces multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.
 All of the coins combined produce: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, **12**, 14, 15, etc.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= coins.length <= 15`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 25`
- `1 <= k <= 2 * 109`
- `coins` contains pairwise distinct integers.
