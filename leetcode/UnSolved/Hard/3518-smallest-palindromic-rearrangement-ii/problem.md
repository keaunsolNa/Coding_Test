# 3518. Smallest Palindromic Rearrangement II

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Hash Table, Math, String, Combinatorics, Counting

## Description

You are given a **palindromic** string `s` and an integer `k`.

 Return the **k-th** **lexicographically smallest** palindromic permutation of `s`. If there are fewer than `k` distinct palindromic permutations, return an empty string.

 **Note:** Different rearrangements that yield the same palindromic string are considered identical and are counted once.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "abba", k = 2

 **Output:** "baab"

 **Explanation:**

 - The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of `"abba"` are `"abba"` and `"baab"`.
- Lexicographically, `"abba"` comes before `"baab"`. Since `k = 2`, the output is `"baab"`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "aa", k = 2

 **Output:** ""

 **Explanation:**

 - There is only one palindromic rearrangement: `"aa"`.
- The output is an empty string since `k = 2` exceeds the number of possible rearrangements.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "bacab", k = 1

 **Output:** "abcba"

 **Explanation:**

 - The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of `"bacab"` are `"abcba"` and `"bacab"`.
- Lexicographically, `"abcba"` comes before `"bacab"`. Since `k = 1`, the output is `"abcba"`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `s` is guaranteed to be palindromic.
- `1 <= k <= 106`
