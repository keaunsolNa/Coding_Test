# 3123. Find Edges in Shortest Paths

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path

## Description

You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. The graph consists of `m` edges represented by a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` with weight `wi`.

 Consider all the shortest paths from node 0 to node `n - 1` in the graph. You need to find a **boolean** array `answer` where `answer[i]` is `true` if the edge `edges[i]` is part of **at least** one shortest path. Otherwise, `answer[i]` is `false`.

 Return the array `answer`.

 **Note** that the graph may not be connected.

 

 **Example 1:**

   **Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1,4],[0,2,1],[1,3,2],[1,4,3],[1,5,1],[2,3,1],[3,5,3],[4,5,2]]

 **Output:** [true,true,true,false,true,true,true,false]

 **Explanation:**

 The following are **all** the shortest paths between nodes 0 and 5:

 - The path `0 -> 1 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `4 + 1 = 5`.
- The path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `1 + 1 + 3 = 5`.
- The path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5`.

  **Example 2:**

   **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[2,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,3,4],[3,2,2]]

 **Output:** [true,false,false,true]

 **Explanation:**

 There is one shortest path between nodes 0 and 3, which is the path `0 -> 2 -> 3` with the sum of weights `1 + 2 = 3`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`
- `m == edges.length`
- `1 <= m <= min(5 * 104, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- `1 <= wi <= 105`
- There are no repeated edges.
