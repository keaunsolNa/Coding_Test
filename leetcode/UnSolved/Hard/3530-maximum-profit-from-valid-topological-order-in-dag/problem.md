# 3530. Maximum Profit from Valid Topological Order in DAG

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Bitmask

## Description

You are given a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates a directed edge from node `ui` to `vi`. Each node has an associated **score** given in an array `score`, where `score[i]` represents the score of node `i`.

 You must process the nodes in a **valid topological order**. Each node is assigned a **1-based position** in the processing order.

 The **profit** is calculated by summing up the product of each node's score and its position in the ordering.

 Return the **maximum **possible profit achievable with an optimal topological order.

 A **topological order** of a DAG is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge `u → v`, node `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], score = [2,3]

 **Output:** 8

 **Explanation:**

 

 Node 1 depends on node 0, so a valid order is `[0, 1]`.

    Node Processing Order Score Multiplier Profit Calculation     0 1st 2 1 2 × 1 = 2   1 2nd 3 2 3 × 2 = 6    The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is `2 + 6 = 8`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], score = [1,6,3]

 **Output:** 25

 **Explanation:**

 

 Nodes 1 and 2 depend on node 0, so the most optimal valid order is `[0, 2, 1]`.

    Node Processing Order Score Multiplier Profit Calculation     0 1st 1 1 1 × 1 = 1   2 2nd 3 2 3 × 2 = 6   1 3rd 6 3 6 × 3 = 18    The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is `1 + 6 + 18 = 25`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == score.length <= 22`
- `1 <= score[i] <= 105`
- `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi]` denotes a directed edge from `ui` to `vi`.
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
- `ui != vi`
- The input graph is **guaranteed** to be a **DAG**.
- There are no duplicate edges.
