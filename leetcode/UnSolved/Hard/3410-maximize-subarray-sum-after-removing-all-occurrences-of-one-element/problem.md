# 3410. Maximize Subarray Sum After Removing All Occurrences of One Element

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Segment Tree

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

 You can do the following operation on the array **at most** once:

 - Choose **any** integer `x` such that `nums` remains **non-empty** on removing all occurrences of `x`.
- Remove **all** occurrences of `x` from the array.

 Return the **maximum** subarray sum across **all** possible resulting arrays.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [-3,2,-2,-1,3,-2,3]

 **Output:** 7

 **Explanation:**

 We can have the following arrays after at most one operation:

 - The original array is `nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]`. The maximum subarray sum is `3 + (-2) + 3 = 4`.
- Deleting all occurences of `x = -3` results in `nums = [2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]`. The maximum subarray sum is `3 + (-2) + 3 = 4`.
- Deleting all occurences of `x = -2` results in `nums = [-3, 2, -1, 3, 3]`. The maximum subarray sum is `2 + (-1) + 3 + 3 = 7`.
- Deleting all occurences of `x = -1` results in `nums = [-3, 2, -2, 3, -2, 3]`. The maximum subarray sum is `3 + (-2) + 3 = 4`.
- Deleting all occurences of `x = 3` results in `nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, -2]`. The maximum subarray sum is 2.

 The output is `max(4, 4, 7, 4, 2) = 7`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

 **Output:** 10

 **Explanation:**

 It is optimal to not perform any operations.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`
