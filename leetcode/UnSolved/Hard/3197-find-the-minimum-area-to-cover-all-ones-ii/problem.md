# 3197. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Matrix, Enumeration

## Description

You are given a 2D **binary** array `grid`. You need to find 3 **non-overlapping** rectangles having **non-zero** areas with horizontal and vertical sides such that all the 1's in `grid` lie inside these rectangles.

 Return the **minimum** possible sum of the area of these rectangles.

 **Note** that the rectangles are allowed to touch.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 

 - The 1's at `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)` are covered by a rectangle of area 2.
- The 1's at `(0, 2)` and `(1, 2)` are covered by a rectangle of area 2.
- The 1 at `(1, 1)` is covered by a rectangle of area 1.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1]]

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 

 - The 1's at `(0, 0)` and `(0, 2)` are covered by a rectangle of area 3.
- The 1 at `(1, 1)` is covered by a rectangle of area 1.
- The 1 at `(1, 3)` is covered by a rectangle of area 1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30`
- `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
- The input is generated such that there are at least three 1's in `grid`.
