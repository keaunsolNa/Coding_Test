# 3405. Count the Number of Arrays with K Matching Adjacent Elements

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Math, Combinatorics

## Description

You are given three integers `n`, `m`, `k`. A **good array** `arr` of size `n` is defined as follows:

 - Each element in `arr` is in the **inclusive** range `[1, m]`.
- _Exactly_ `k` indices `i` (where `1 <= i < n`) satisfy the condition `arr[i - 1] == arr[i]`.

 Return the number of **good arrays** that can be formed.

 Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo **`109 + 7`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 3, m = 2, k = 1

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 - There are 4 good arrays. They are `[1, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 2]`, `[2, 1, 1]` and `[2, 2, 1]`.
- Hence, the answer is 4.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 4, m = 2, k = 2

 **Output:** 6

 **Explanation:**

 - The good arrays are `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, `[1, 2, 2, 2]`, `[2, 1, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1, 1]` and `[2, 2, 2, 1]`.
- Hence, the answer is 6.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 5, m = 2, k = 0

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - The good arrays are `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. Hence, the answer is 2.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= m <= 105`
- `0 <= k <= n - 1`
