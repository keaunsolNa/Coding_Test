# 3886. Sum of Sortable Integers

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Math, Sorting, Enumeration

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

 An integer `k` is called **sortable** if `k` **divides** `n` and you can sort `nums` in **non-decreasing** order by sequentially performing the following operations:

 - Partition `nums` into **consecutive subarrays** of length `k`.
- **Cyclically rotate each subarray independently** any number of times to the left or to the right.

 Return an integer denoting the sum of all possible sortable integers `k`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [3,1,2]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - For `n = 3`, possible divisors are 1 and 3.
- For `k = 1`: each subarray has one element. No rotation can sort the array.
- For `k = 3`: the single subarray `[3, 1, 2]` can be rotated once to produce `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.
- Only `k = 3` is sortable. Hence, the answer is 3.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [7,6,5]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 - For `n = 3`, possible divisors are 1 and 3.
- For `k = 1`: each subarray has one element. No rotation can sort the array.
- For `k = 3`: the single subarray `[7, 6, 5]` cannot be rotated into non-decreasing order.
- No `k` is sortable. Hence, the answer is 0.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [5,8]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - For `n = 2`, possible divisors are 1 and 2.
- Since `[5, 8]` is already sorted, every divisor is sortable. Hence, the answer is `1 + 2 = 3`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
