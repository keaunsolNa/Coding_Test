# 3812. Minimum Edge Toggles on a Tree

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Graph Theory, Topological Sort, Sorting

## Description

You are given an **undirected tree** with `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

 You are also given two **binary** strings `start` and `target` of length `n`. For each node `x`, `start[x]` is its initial color and `target[x]` is its desired color.

 In one operation, you may pick an edge with index `i` and **toggle **both of its endpoints. That is, if the edge is `[u, v]`, then the colors of nodes `u` and `v` **each** flip from `'0'` to `'1'` or from `'1'` to `'0'`.

 Return an array of edge indices whose operations transform `start` into `target`. Among all valid sequences with **minimum possible length**, return the edge indices in **increasing** order.

 If it is impossible to transform `start` into `target`, return an array containing a single element equal to -1.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ****

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], start = "010", target = "100"

 **Output:** [0]

 **Explanation:**

 Toggle edge with index 0, which flips nodes 0 and 1.
 The string changes from `"010"` to `"100"`, matching the target.

  **Example 2:**

 ****

  **Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[3,5],[1,6]], start = "0011000", target = "0010001"

 **Output:** [1,2,5]

 **Explanation:**

 - Toggle edge with index 1, which flips nodes 1 and 2.
- Toggle edge with index 2, which flips nodes 2 and 3.
- Toggle edge with index 5, which flips nodes 1 and 6.

 After these operations, the resulting string becomes `"0010001"`, which matches the target.

  **Example 3:**

 ****

  **Input:** n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], start = "00", target = "01"

 **Output:** [-1]

 **Explanation:**

 There is no sequence of edge toggles that transforms `"00"` into `"01"`. Therefore, we return `[-1]`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= n == start.length == target.length <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `start[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- `target[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
