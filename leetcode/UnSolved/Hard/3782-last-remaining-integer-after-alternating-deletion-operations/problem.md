# 3782. Last Remaining Integer After Alternating Deletion Operations

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Math, Recursion

## Description

You are given an integer `n`.

 We write the integers from 1 to `n` in a sequence from left to right. Then, **alternately** apply the following two operations until only one integer remains, starting with operation 1:

 - **Operation 1**: Starting from the left, delete every second number.
- **Operation 2**: Starting from the right, delete every second number.

 Return the last remaining integer.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 8

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - Write `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` in a sequence.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The remaining integers are `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.
- Starting from the right, we delete every second number: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`. The remaining integers are `[3, 7]`.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[3, 7]`. The remaining integer is `[3]`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 5

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 - Write `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` in a sequence.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The remaining integers are `[1, 3, 5]`.
- Starting from the right, we delete every second number: `[1, 3, 5]`. The remaining integers are `[1, 5]`.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[1, 5]`. The remaining integer is `[1]`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 1

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 - Write `[1]` in a sequence.
- The last remaining integer is 1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 1015`
