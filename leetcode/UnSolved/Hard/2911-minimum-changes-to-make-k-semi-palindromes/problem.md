# 2911. Minimum Changes to Make K Semi-palindromes

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Two Pointers, String, Dynamic Programming

## Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, partition `s` into `k` **substrings** such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a **semi-palindrome** are minimized.

 Return the _**minimum** number of letter changes_ required_._

 A **semi-palindrome** is a special type of string that can be divided into **palindromes** based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:

 1. Choose a positive divisor `d` of the string's length. `d` can range from `1` up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length `1`, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.
2. For a given divisor `d`, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length `d`. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions `1`, `1 + d`, `1 + 2d`, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions `2`, `2 + d`, `2 + 2d`, etc.
3. The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.

 Consider the string `"abcabc"`:

 - The length of `"abcabc"` is `6`. Valid divisors are `1`, `2`, and `3`.
- For `d = 1`: The entire string `"abcabc"` forms one group. Not a palindrome.
- For `d = 2`: - Group 1 (positions `1, 3, 5`): `"acb"`
- Group 2 (positions `2, 4, 6`): `"bac"`
- Neither group forms a palindrome.
- For `d = 3`: - Group 1 (positions `1, 4`): `"aa"`
- Group 2 (positions `2, 5`): `"bb"`
- Group 3 (positions `3, 6`): `"cc"`
- All groups form palindromes. Therefore, `"abcabc"` is a semi-palindrome.

 

 **Example 1: **

  **Input: **  s = "abcac", k = 2

 **Output: **  1

 **Explanation: ** Divide `s` into `"ab"` and `"cac"`. `"cac"` is already semi-palindrome. Change `"ab"` to `"aa"`, it becomes semi-palindrome with `d = 1`.

  **Example 2: **

  **Input: **  s = "abcdef", k = 2

 **Output: **  2

 **Explanation: ** Divide `s` into substrings `"abc"` and `"def"`. Each needs one change to become semi-palindrome.

  **Example 3: **

  **Input: **  s = "aabbaa", k = 3

 **Output: **  0

 **Explanation: ** Divide `s` into substrings `"aa"`, `"bb"` and `"aa"`. All are already semi-palindromes.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= s.length <= 200`
- `1 <= k <= s.length / 2`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
