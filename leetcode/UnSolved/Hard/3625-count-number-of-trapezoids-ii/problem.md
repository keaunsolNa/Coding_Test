# 3625. Count Number of Trapezoids II

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Math, Geometry

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the `ith` point on the Cartesian plane.

 Return _the number of unique __trapezoids_ that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from `points`.

 A** ****trapezoid** is a convex quadrilateral with **at least one pair** of parallel sides. Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** points = [[-3,2],[3,0],[2,3],[3,2],[2,-3]]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 

 There are two distinct ways to pick four points that form a trapezoid:

 - The points `[-3,2], [2,3], [3,2], [2,-3]` form one trapezoid.
- The points `[2,3], [3,2], [3,0], [2,-3]` form another trapezoid.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 

 There is only one trapezoid which can be formed.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `4 <= points.length <= 500`
- `–1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000`
- All points are pairwise distinct.
