# 3414. Maximum Score of Non-overlapping Intervals

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, Sorting

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [li, ri, weighti]`. Interval `i` starts at position `li` and ends at `ri`, and has a weight of `weighti`. You can choose _up to_ 4 **non-overlapping** intervals. The **score** of the chosen intervals is defined as the total sum of their weights.

 Return the lexicographically smallest array of at most 4 indices from `intervals` with **maximum** score, representing your choice of non-overlapping intervals.

 Two intervals are said to be **non-overlapping** if they do not share any points. In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are considered overlapping.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** intervals = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5],[6,9,3],[6,7,1],[8,9,1]]

 **Output:** [2,3]

 **Explanation:**

 You can choose the intervals with indices 2, and 3 with respective weights of 5, and 3.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** intervals = [[5,8,1],[6,7,7],[4,7,3],[9,10,6],[7,8,2],[11,14,3],[3,5,5]]

 **Output:** [1,3,5,6]

 **Explanation:**

 You can choose the intervals with indices 1, 3, 5, and 6 with respective weights of 7, 6, 3, and 5.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= intevals.length <= 5 * 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 3`
- `intervals[i] = [li, ri, weighti]`
- `1 <= li <= ri <= 109`
- `1 <= weighti <= 109`
