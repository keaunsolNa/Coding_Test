# 3382. Maximum Area Rectangle With Point Constraints II

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Math, Binary Indexed Tree, Segment Tree, Geometry, Sorting

## Description

There are n points on an infinite plane. You are given two integer arrays `xCoord` and `yCoord` where `(xCoord[i], yCoord[i])` represents the coordinates of the `ith` point.

 Your task is to find the **maximum **area of a rectangle that:

 - Can be formed using **four** of these points as its corners.
- Does **not** contain any other point inside or on its border.
- Has its edges **parallel** to the axes.

 Return the **maximum area** that you can obtain or -1 if no such rectangle is possible.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** xCoord = [1,1,3,3], yCoord = [1,3,1,3]

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 ****

 We can make a rectangle with these 4 points as corners and there is no other point that lies inside or on the border. Hence, the maximum possible area would be 4.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** xCoord = [1,1,3,3,2], yCoord = [1,3,1,3,2]

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 ****

 There is only one rectangle possible is with points `[1,1], [1,3], [3,1]` and `[3,3]` but `[2,2]` will always lie inside it. Hence, returning -1.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** xCoord = [1,1,3,3,1,3], yCoord = [1,3,1,3,2,2]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 ****

 The maximum area rectangle is formed by the points `[1,3], [1,2], [3,2], [3,3]`, which has an area of 2. Additionally, the points `[1,1], [1,2], [3,1], [3,2]` also form a valid rectangle with the same area.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= xCoord.length == yCoord.length <= 2 * 105`
- `0 <= xCoord[i], yCoord[i] <= 8 * 107`
- All the given points are **unique**.
