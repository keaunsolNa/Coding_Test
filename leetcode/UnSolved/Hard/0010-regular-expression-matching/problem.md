# 10. Regular Expression Matching

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** String, Dynamic Programming, Recursion

## Description

Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

 - `'.'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

 Return a boolean indicating whether the matching covers the entire input string (not partial).

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `1 <= p.length <= 20`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
- It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.
