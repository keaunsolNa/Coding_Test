# 336. Palindrome Pairs

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, String, Trie, Hash Function

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of **unique** strings `words`.

 A **palindrome pair** is a pair of integers `(i, j)` such that:

 - `0 <= i, j < words.length`,
- `i != j`, and
- `words[i] + words[j]` (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome.

 Return _an array of all the **palindrome pairs** of _`words`.

 You must write an algorithm with `O(sum of words[i].length)` runtime complexity.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: words = ["bat","tab","cat"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: words = ["a",""]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["a","a"]
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `0 <= words[i].length <= 300`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
