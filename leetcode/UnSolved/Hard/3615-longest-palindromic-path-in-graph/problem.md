# 3615. Longest Palindromic Path in Graph

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** String, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Graph Theory, Bitmask

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1` and a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

 You are also given a string `label` of length `n`, where `label[i]` is the character associated with node `i`.

 You may start at any node and move to any adjacent node, visiting each node **at most** once.

 Return the **maximum** possible length of a **palindrome** that can be formed by visiting a set of **unique** nodes along a valid path.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], label = "aba"

 **Output:** 3

 **Exp****lanation:**

 

 - The longest palindromic path is from node 0 to node 2 via node 1, following the path `0 → 1 → 2` forming string `"aba"`.
- This is a valid palindrome of length 3.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], label = "abc"

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 

 - No path with more than one node forms a palindrome.
- The best option is any single node, giving a palindrome of length 1.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[0,3],[3,1]], label = "bbac"

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 

 - The longest palindromic path is from node 0 to node 1, following the path `0 → 3 → 1`, forming string `"bcb"`.
- This is a valid palindrome of length 3.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 14`
- `n - 1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `label.length == n`
- `label` consists of lowercase English letters.
- There are no duplicate edges.
