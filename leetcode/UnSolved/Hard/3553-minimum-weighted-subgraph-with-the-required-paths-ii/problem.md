# 3553. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths II

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Tree, Depth-First Search

## Description

You are given an **undirected weighted** tree with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight `wi`.

 Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [src1j, src2j, destj]`.

 Return an array `answer` of length equal to `queries.length`, where `answer[j]` is the **minimum total weight** of a subtree such that it is possible to reach `destj` from both `src1j` and `src2j` using edges in this subtree.

 A **subtree** here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original tree forming a valid tree.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], queries = [[2,3,4],[0,2,5]]

 **Output:** [12,11]

 **Explanation:**

 The blue edges represent one of the subtrees that yield the optimal answer.

 

 - `answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 2` and `src2 = 3` to `dest = 4` is `3 + 5 + 4 = 12`.
- `answer[1]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 2` to `dest = 5` is `2 + 3 + 6 = 11`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** edges = [[1,0,8],[0,2,7]], queries = [[0,1,2]]

 **Output:** [15]

 **Explanation:**

 

 - `answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 1` to `dest = 2` is `8 + 7 = 15`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `3 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
- `1 <= wi <= 104`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
- `queries[j].length == 3`
- `0 <= src1j, src2j, destj < n`
- `src1j`, `src2j`, and `destj` are pairwise distinct.
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
