# 3464. Maximize the Distance Between Points on a Square

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Math, Binary Search, Geometry, Sorting

## Description

You are given an integer `side`, representing the edge length of a square with corners at `(0, 0)`, `(0, side)`, `(side, 0)`, and `(side, side)` on a Cartesian plane.

 You are also given a **positive** integer `k` and a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinate of a point lying on the **boundary** of the square.

 You need to select `k` elements among `points` such that the **minimum** Manhattan distance between any two points is **maximized**.

 Return the **maximum** possible **minimum** Manhattan distance between the selected `k` points.

 The Manhattan Distance between two cells `(xi, yi)` and `(xj, yj)` is `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** side = 2, points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], k = 4

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 

 Select all four points.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** side = 2, points = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 4

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 

 Select the points `(0, 0)`, `(2, 0)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 1)`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** side = 2, points = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 5

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 

 Select the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 2)`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= side <= 109`
- `4 <= points.length <= min(4 * side, 15 * 103)`
- `points[i] == [xi, yi]`
- The input is generated such that: - `points[i]` lies on the boundary of the square.
- All `points[i]` are **unique**.
- `4 <= k <= min(25, points.length)`
