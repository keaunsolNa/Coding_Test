# 3841. Palindromic Path Queries in a Tree

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, String, Divide and Conquer, Tree, Segment Tree

## Description

You are given an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

 You are also given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, where `s[i]` represents the character assigned to node `i`.

 You are also given a string array `queries`, where each `queries[i]` is either:

 - `"update ui c"`: Change the character at node `ui` to `c`. Formally, update `s[ui] = c`.
- `"query ui vi"`: Determine whether the string formed by the characters on the **unique** path from `ui` to `vi` (inclusive) can be **rearranged** into a **palindrome**.

 Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is `true` if the `jth` query of type `"query ui vi"` can be rearranged into a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], s = "aac", queries = ["query 0 2","update 1 b","query 0 2"]

 **Output:** [true,false]

 **Explanation:**

 - `"query 0 2"`: Path `0 → 1 → 2` gives `"aac"`, which can be rearranged to form `"aca"`, a palindrome. Thus, `answer[0] = true`.
- `"update 1 b"`: Update node 1 to `'b'`, now `s = "abc"`.
- `"query 0 2"`: Path characters are `"abc"`, which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, `answer[1] = false`.

 Thus, `answer = [true, false]`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], s = "abca", queries = ["query 1 2","update 0 b","query 2 3","update 3 a","query 1 3"]

 **Output:** [false,false,true]

 **Explanation:**

 - `"query 1 2"`: Path `1 → 0 → 2` gives `"bac"`, which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, `answer[0] = false`.
- `"update 0 b"`: Update node 0 to `'b'`, now `s = "bbca"`.
- `"query 2 3"`: Path `2 → 0 → 3` gives `"cba"`, which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, `answer[1] = false`.
- `"update 3 a"`: Update node 3 to `'a'`, `s = "bbca"`.
- `"query 1 3"`: Path `1 → 0 → 3` gives `"bba"`, which can be rearranged to form `"bab"`, a palindrome. Thus, `answer[2] = true`.

 Thus, `answer = [false, false, true]`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104` - `queries[i] = "update ui c"` or
- `queries[i] = "query ui vi"`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `c` is a lowercase English letter.
