# 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Dynamic Programming

## Description

You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: **Red**, **Yellow,** or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

 Given `n` the number of rows of the grid, return _the number of ways_ you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `109 + 7`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == grid.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
