# 3786. Total Sum of Interaction Cost in Tree Groups

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, Tree, Depth-First Search

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an undirected tree with `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

 You are also given an integer array `group` of length `n`, where `group[i]` denotes the group label assigned to node `i`.

 - Two nodes `u` and `v` are considered part of the same group if `group[u] == group[v]`.
- The **interaction cost** between `u` and `v` is defined as the number of edges on the unique path connecting them in the tree.

 Return an integer denoting the **sum** of interaction costs over all **unordered** pairs `(u, v)` with `u != v` such that `group[u] == group[v]`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], group = [1,1,1]

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 ****

 All nodes belong to group 1. The interaction costs between the pairs of nodes are:

 - Nodes `(0, 1)`: 1
- Nodes `(1, 2)`: 1
- Nodes `(0, 2)`: 2

 Thus, the total interaction cost is `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], group = [3,2,3]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - Nodes 0 and 2 belong to group 3. The interaction cost between this pair is 2.
- Node 1 belongs to a different group and forms no valid pair. Therefore, the total interaction cost is 2.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], group = [1,1,4,4]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 

 Nodes belonging to the same groups and their interaction costs are:

 - Group 1: Nodes `(0, 1)`: 1
- Group 4: Nodes `(2, 3)`: 2

 Thus, the total interaction cost is `1 + 2 = 3`.

  **Example 4:**

  **Input:** n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], group = [9,8]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 All nodes belong to different groups and there are no valid pairs. Therefore, the total interaction cost is 0.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `group.length == n`
- `1 <= group[i] <= 20`
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
