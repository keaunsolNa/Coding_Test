# 3389. Minimum Operations to Make Character Frequencies Equal

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Hash Table, String, Dynamic Programming, Counting, Enumeration

## Description

You are given a string `s`.

 A string `t` is called **good** if all characters of `t` occur the same number of times.

 You can perform the following operations **any number of times**:

 - Delete a character from `s`.
- Insert a character in `s`.
- Change a character in `s` to its next letter in the alphabet.

 **Note** that you cannot change `'z'` to `'a'` using the third operation.

 Return_ _the **minimum** number of operations required to make `s` **good**.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "acab"

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 We can make `s` good by deleting one occurrence of character `'a'`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "wddw"

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 We do not need to perform any operations since `s` is initially good.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "aaabc"

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 We can make `s` good by applying these operations:

 - Change one occurrence of `'a'` to `'b'`
- Insert one occurrence of `'c'` into `s`

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `3 <= s.length <= 2 * 104`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
