# 3501. Maximize Active Section with Trade II

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Tags:** Array, String, Binary Search, Segment Tree

## Description

You are given a binary string `s` of length `n`, where:

 - `'1'` represents an **active** section.
- `'0'` represents an **inactive** section.

 You can perform **at most one trade** to maximize the number of active sections in `s`. In a trade, you:

 - Convert a contiguous block of `'1'`s that is surrounded by `'0'`s to all `'0'`s.
- Afterward, convert a contiguous block of `'0'`s that is surrounded by `'1'`s to all `'1'`s.

 Additionally, you are given a **2D array** `queries`, where `queries[i] = [li, ri]` represents a substring `s[li...ri]`.

 For each query, determine the **maximum** possible number of active sections in `s` after making the optimal trade on the substring `s[li...ri]`.

 Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the result for `queries[i]`.

 **Note**

 - For each query, treat `s[li...ri]` as if it is **augmented** with a `'1'` at both ends, forming `t = '1' + s[li...ri] + '1'`. The augmented `'1'`s **do not** contribute to the final count.
- The queries are independent of each other.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "01", queries = [[0,1]]

 **Output:** [1]

 **Explanation:**

 Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "0100", queries = [[0,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]

 **Output:** [4,3,1,1]

 **Explanation:**

 - Query `[0, 3]` → Substring `"0100"` → Augmented to `"101001"`
 Choose `"0100"`, convert `"0100"` → `"0000"` → `"1111"`.
 The final string without augmentation is `"1111"`. The maximum number of active sections is 4.
- Query `[0, 2]` → Substring `"010"` → Augmented to `"10101"`
 Choose `"010"`, convert `"010"` → `"000"` → `"111"`.
 The final string without augmentation is `"1110"`. The maximum number of active sections is 3.
- Query `[1, 3]` → Substring `"100"` → Augmented to `"11001"`
 Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.
- Query `[2, 3]` → Substring `"00"` → Augmented to `"1001"`
 Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "1000100", queries = [[1,5],[0,6],[0,4]]

 **Output:** [6,7,2]

 **Explanation:**

 - Query `[1, 5]` → Substring `"00010"` → Augmented to `"1000101"`
 Choose `"00010"`, convert `"00010"` → `"00000"` → `"11111"`.
 The final string without augmentation is `"1111110"`. The maximum number of active sections is 6.
- Query `[0, 6]` → Substring `"1000100"` → Augmented to `"110001001"`
 Choose `"000100"`, convert `"000100"` → `"000000"` → `"111111"`.
 The final string without augmentation is `"1111111"`. The maximum number of active sections is 7.
- Query `[0, 4]` → Substring `"10001"` → Augmented to `"1100011"`
 Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 2.

  **Example 4:**

  **Input:** s = "01010", queries = [[0,3],[1,4],[1,3]]

 **Output:** [4,4,2]

 **Explanation:**

 - Query `[0, 3]` → Substring `"0101"` → Augmented to `"101011"`
 Choose `"010"`, convert `"010"` → `"000"` → `"111"`.
 The final string without augmentation is `"11110"`. The maximum number of active sections is 4.
- Query `[1, 4]` → Substring `"1010"` → Augmented to `"110101"`
 Choose `"010"`, convert `"010"` → `"000"` → `"111"`.
 The final string without augmentation is `"01111"`. The maximum number of active sections is 4.
- Query `[1, 3]` → Substring `"101"` → Augmented to `"11011"`
 Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 2.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == s.length <= 105`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- `queries[i] = [li, ri]`
- `0 <= li <= ri < n`
