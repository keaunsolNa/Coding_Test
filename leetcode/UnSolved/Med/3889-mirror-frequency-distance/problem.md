# 3889. Mirror Frequency Distance

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Hash Table, String, Counting

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.

 For each character, its **mirror character** is defined by reversing the order of its character set:

 - For letters, the mirror of a character is the letter at the same position from the end of the alphabet. - For example, the mirror of `'a'` is `'z'`, and the mirror of `'b'` is `'y'`, and so on.
- For digits, the mirror of a character is the digit at the same position from the end of the range `'0'` to `'9'`. - For example, the mirror of `'0'` is `'9'`, and the mirror of `'1'` is `'8'`, and so on.

 For each **unique** character `c` in the string:

 - Let `m` be its **mirror** character.
- Let `freq(x)` denote the number of times character `x` appears in the string.
- Compute the **absolute difference** between their **frequencies**, defined as: `|freq(c) - freq(m)|`

 The mirror pairs `(c, m)` and `(m, c)` are the same and must be counted **only once**.

 Return an integer denoting the total sum of these values over all such **distinct mirror pairs**.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "ab1z9"

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 For every mirror pair:

    `c` `m` `freq(c)` `freq(m)` `|freq(c) - freq(m)|`     a z 1 1 0   b y 1 0 1   1 8 1 0 1   9 0 1 0 1    Thus, the answer is `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "4m7n"

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

    `c` `m` `freq(c)` `freq(m)` `|freq(c) - freq(m)|`     4 5 1 0 1   m n 1 1 0   7 2 1 0 1    Thus, the answer is `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "byby"

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

    `c` `m` `freq(c)` `freq(m)` `|freq(c) - freq(m)|`     b y 2 2 0    Thus, the answer is 0.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
