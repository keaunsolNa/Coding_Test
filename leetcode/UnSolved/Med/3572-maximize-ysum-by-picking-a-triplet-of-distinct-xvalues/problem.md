# 3572. Maximize Y‑Sum by Picking a Triplet of Distinct X‑Values

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)

## Description

You are given two integer arrays `x` and `y`, each of length `n`. You must choose three **distinct** indices `i`, `j`, and `k` such that:

 - `x[i] != x[j]`
- `x[j] != x[k]`
- `x[k] != x[i]`

 Your goal is to **maximize** the value of `y[i] + y[j] + y[k]` under these conditions. Return the **maximum** possible sum that can be obtained by choosing such a triplet of indices.

 If no such triplet exists, return -1.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** x = [1,2,1,3,2], y = [5,3,4,6,2]

 **Output:** 14

 **Explanation:**

 - Choose `i = 0` (`x[i] = 1`, `y[i] = 5`), `j = 1` (`x[j] = 2`, `y[j] = 3`), `k = 3` (`x[k] = 3`, `y[k] = 6`).
- All three values chosen from `x` are distinct. `5 + 3 + 6 = 14` is the maximum we can obtain. Hence, the output is 14.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** x = [1,2,1,2], y = [4,5,6,7]

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 - There are only two distinct values in `x`. Hence, the output is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == x.length == y.length`
- `3 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= x[i], y[i] <= 106`
