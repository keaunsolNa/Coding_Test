# 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting, Matrix

## Description

You are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and you are allowed to rearrange the **columns** of the `matrix` in any order.

 Return _the area of the largest submatrix within _`matrix`_ where **every** element of the submatrix is _`1`_ after reordering the columns optimally._

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.
```

 **Example 2:**

  ```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m * n <= 105`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
