# 2711. Difference of Number of Distinct Values on Diagonals

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Matrix

## Description

Given a 2D `grid` of size `m x n`, you should find the matrix `answer` of size `m x n`.

 The cell `answer[r][c]` is calculated by looking at the diagonal values of the cell `grid[r][c]`:

 - Let `leftAbove[r][c]` be the number of **distinct** values on the diagonal to the left and above the cell `grid[r][c]` not including the cell `grid[r][c]` itself.
- Let `rightBelow[r][c]` be the number of **distinct** values on the diagonal to the right and below the cell `grid[r][c]`, not including the cell `grid[r][c]` itself.
- Then `answer[r][c] = |leftAbove[r][c] - rightBelow[r][c]|`.

 A **matrix diagonal** is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until the end of the matrix is reached.

 - For example, in the below diagram the diagonal is highlighted using the cell with indices `(2, 3)` colored gray: - Red-colored cells are left and above the cell.
- Blue-colored cells are right and below the cell.

 

 Return the matrix `answer`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,2,3],[3,1,5],[3,2,1]]

 **Output:** Output: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]

 **Explanation:**

 To calculate the `answer` cells:

    answer left-above elements leftAbove right-below elements rightBelow |leftAbove - rightBelow|     [0][0] [] 0 [grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] |{1, 1}| = 1 1   [0][1] [] 0 [grid[1][2]] |{5}| = 1 1   [0][2] [] 0 [] 0 0   [1][0] [] 0 [grid[2][1]] |{2}| = 1 1   [1][1] [grid[0][0]] |{1}| = 1 [grid[2][2]] |{1}| = 1 0   [1][2] [grid[0][1]] |{2}| = 1 [] 0 1   [2][0] [] 0 [] 0 0   [2][1] [grid[1][0]] |{3}| = 1 [] 0 1   [2][2] [grid[0][0], grid[1][1]] |{1, 1}| = 1 [] 0 1     **Example 2:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1]]

 **Output:** Output: [[0]]

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n, grid[i][j] <= 50`
