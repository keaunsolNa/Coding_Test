# 3891. Minimum Increase to Maximize Special Indices

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Prefix Sum

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

 An index `i` (`0 < i < n - 1`) is **special** if `nums[i] > nums[i - 1]` and `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`.

 You may perform operations where you choose **any** index `i` and **increase** `nums[i]` by 1.

 Your goal is to:

 - **Maximize** the number of **special** indices.
- **Minimize** the total number of **operations** required to achieve that **maximum**.

 Return an integer denoting the **minimum** total number of operations required.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,2,2]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 - Start with `nums = [1, 2, 2]`.
- Increase `nums[1]` by 1, array becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.
- The final array is `[1, 3, 2]` has 1 special index, which is the maximum achievable.
- It is impossible to achieve this number of special indices with fewer operations. Thus, the answer is 1.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,1,1,3]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - Start with `nums = [2, 1, 1, 3]`.
- Perform 2 operations at index 1, array becomes `[2, 3, 1, 3]`.
- The final array is `[2, 3, 1, 3]` has 1 special index, which is the maximum achievable. Thus, the answer is 2.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [5,2,1,4,3]

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 - Start with `nums = [5, 2, 1, 4, 3]`.
- Perform 4 operations at index 1, array becomes `[5, 6, 1, 4, 3]`.
- The final array is `[5, 6, 1, 4, 3]` has 2 special indices, which is the maximum achievable. Thus, the answer is 4.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `3 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
