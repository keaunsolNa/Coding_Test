# 3066. Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Heap (Priority Queue), Simulation

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, and an integer `k`.

 You are allowed to perform some operations on `nums`, where in a single operation, you can:

 - Select the two **smallest** integers `x` and `y` from `nums`.
- Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.
- Insert `(min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y))` at any position in the array.

 **Note** that you can only apply the described operation if `nums` contains **at least** two elements.

 Return the **minimum** number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are **greater than or equal to** `k`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,11,10,1,3], k = 10

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 1. In the first operation, we remove elements 1 and 2, then add `1 * 2 + 2` to `nums`. `nums` becomes equal to `[4, 11, 10, 3]`.
2. In the second operation, we remove elements 3 and 4, then add `3 * 2 + 4` to `nums`. `nums` becomes equal to `[10, 11, 10]`.

 At this stage, all the elements of nums are greater than or equal to 10 so we can stop.

 It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than or equal to 10.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,1,2,4,9], k = 20

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 1. After one operation, `nums` becomes equal to `[2, 4, 9, 3]`.
2. After two operations, `nums` becomes equal to `[7, 4, 9]`.
3. After three operations, `nums` becomes equal to `[15, 9]`.
4. After four operations, `nums` becomes equal to `[33]`.

 At this stage, all the elements of `nums` are greater than 20 so we can stop.

 It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than or equal to 20.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= k <= 109`
- The input is generated such that an answer always exists. That is, after performing some number of operations, all elements of the array are greater than or equal to `k`.
