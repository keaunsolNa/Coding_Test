# 176. Second Highest Salary

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Database

## Description

Table: `Employee`

 ```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```

 

 Write a solution to find the second highest **distinct** salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, return `null (return None in Pandas)`.

 The result format is in the following example.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```
