# 3722. Lexicographically Smallest String After Reverse

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Two Pointers, Binary Search, Enumeration

## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters.

 You must perform **exactly** one operation by choosing any integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= n` and either:

 - reverse the **first** `k` characters of `s`, or
- reverse the **last** `k` characters of `s`.

 Return the **lexicographically smallest** string that can be obtained after **exactly** one such operation.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "dcab"

 **Output:** "acdb"

 **Explanation:**

 - Choose `k = 3`, reverse the first 3 characters.
- Reverse `"dca"` to `"acd"`, resulting string `s = "acdb"`, which is the lexicographically smallest string achievable.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "abba"

 **Output:** "aabb"

 **Explanation:**

 - Choose `k = 3`, reverse the last 3 characters.
- Reverse `"bba"` to `"abb"`, so the resulting string is `"aabb"`, which is the lexicographically smallest string achievable.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "zxy"

 **Output:** "xzy"

 **Explanation:**

 - Choose `k = 2`, reverse the first 2 characters.
- Reverse `"zx"` to `"xz"`, so the resulting string is `"xzy"`, which is the lexicographically smallest string achievable.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
