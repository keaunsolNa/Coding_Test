# 695. Max Area of Island

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union-Find, Matrix

## Description

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

 The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

 Return _the maximum **area** of an island in _`grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
