# 3618. Split Array by Prime Indices

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Math, Number Theory

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

 Split `nums` into two arrays `A` and `B` using the following rule:

 - Elements at **prime** indices in `nums` must go into array `A`.
- All other elements must go into array `B`.

 Return the **absolute** difference between the sums of the two arrays: `|sum(A) - sum(B)|`.

 **Note:** An empty array has a sum of 0.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,3,4]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 - The only prime index in the array is 2, so `nums[2] = 4` is placed in array `A`.
- The remaining elements, `nums[0] = 2` and `nums[1] = 3` are placed in array `B`.
- `sum(A) = 4`, `sum(B) = 2 + 3 = 5`.
- The absolute difference is `|4 - 5| = 1`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [-1,5,7,0]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - The prime indices in the array are 2 and 3, so `nums[2] = 7` and `nums[3] = 0` are placed in array `A`.
- The remaining elements, `nums[0] = -1` and `nums[1] = 5` are placed in array `B`.
- `sum(A) = 7 + 0 = 7`, `sum(B) = -1 + 5 = 4`.
- The absolute difference is `|7 - 4| = 3`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
