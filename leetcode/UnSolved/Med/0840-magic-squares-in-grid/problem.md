# 840. Magic Squares In Grid

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Math, Matrix

## Description

A `3 x 3` **magic square** is a `3 x 3` grid filled with distinct numbers **from **1** to **9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

 Given a `row x col` `grid` of integers, how many `3 x 3` magic square subgrids are there?

 Note: while a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9, `grid` may contain numbers up to 15.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:

while this one is not:

In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: grid = [[8]]
Output: 0
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `row == grid.length`
- `col == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= row, col <= 10`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`
