# 3346. Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Sorting, Prefix Sum

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `numOperations`.

 You must perform an **operation** `numOperations` times on `nums`, where in each operation you:

 - Select an index `i` that was **not** selected in any previous operations.
- Add an integer in the range `[-k, k]` to `nums[i]`.

 Return the **maximum** possible frequency of any element in `nums` after performing the **operations**.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

 - Adding 0 to `nums[1]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 4, 5]`.
- Adding -1 to `nums[2]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 4, 4]`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [5,11,20,20], k = 5, numOperations = 1

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

 - Adding 0 to `nums[1]`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
- `0 <= k <= 105`
- `0 <= numOperations <= nums.length`
