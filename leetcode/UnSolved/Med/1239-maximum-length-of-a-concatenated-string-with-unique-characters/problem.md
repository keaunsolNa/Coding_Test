# 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, String, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation

## Description

You are given an array of strings `arr`. A string `s` is formed by the **concatenation** of a **subsequence** of `arr` that has **unique characters**.

 Return _the **maximum** possible length_ of `s`.

 A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers").
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
Output: 26
Explanation: The only string in arr has all 26 characters.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= arr.length <= 16`
- `1 <= arr[i].length <= 26`
- `arr[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.
