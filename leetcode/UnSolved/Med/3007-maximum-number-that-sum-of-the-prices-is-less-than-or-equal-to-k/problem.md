# 3007. Maximum Number That Sum of the Prices Is Less Than or Equal to K

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Math, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation

## Description

You are given an integer `k` and an integer `x`. The price of a number `num` is calculated by the count of set bits at positions `x`, `2x`, `3x`, etc., in its binary representation, starting from the least significant bit. The following table contains examples of how price is calculated.

    x num Binary Representation Price   1 13 00000**1****1**0**1** 3   2 13 00000**1**101 1   2 233 0**1**1**1**0**1**001 3   3 13 000001**1**01 1   3 362 **1**01**1**01010 2    The **accumulated price** of `num` is the **total** price of numbers from `1` to `num`. `num` is considered **cheap** if its accumulated price is less than or equal to `k`.

 Return the **greatest** cheap number.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** k = 9, x = 1

 **Output:** 6

 **Explanation:**

 As shown in the table below, `6` is the greatest cheap number.

  **Input:** k = 7, x = 2

 **Output:** 9

 **Explanation:**

 As shown in the table below, `9` is the greatest cheap number.
