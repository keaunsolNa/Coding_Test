# 227. Basic Calculator II

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Math, String, Stack

## Description

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, _evaluate this expression and return its value_.

 The integer division should truncate toward zero.

 You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-231, 231 - 1]`.

 **Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```

**Example 2:**

 ```
Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

 ```
Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
- `s` consists of integers and operators `('+', '-', '*', '/')` separated by some number of spaces.
- `s` represents **a valid expression**.
- All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 231 - 1]`.
- The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit integer**.
