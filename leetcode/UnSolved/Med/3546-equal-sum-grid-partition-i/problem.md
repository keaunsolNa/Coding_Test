# 3546. Equal Sum Grid Partition I

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Matrix, Enumeration, Prefix Sum

## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make **either one horizontal or one vertical cut** on the grid such that:

 - Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is **non-empty**.
- The sum of the elements in both sections is **equal**.

 Return `true` if such a partition exists; otherwise return `false`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

 **Output:** true

 **Explanation:**

 

 A horizontal cut between row 0 and row 1 results in two non-empty sections, each with a sum of 5. Thus, the answer is `true`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,3],[2,4]]

 **Output:** false

 **Explanation:**

 No horizontal or vertical cut results in two non-empty sections with equal sums. Thus, the answer is `false`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= m == grid.length <= 105`
- `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 105`
- `2 <= m * n <= 105`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`
