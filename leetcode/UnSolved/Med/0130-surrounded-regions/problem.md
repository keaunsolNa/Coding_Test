# 130. Surrounded Regions

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union-Find, Matrix

## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

 - **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
- **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.
- **Surround**: A region is surrounded if none of the `'O'` cells in that region are on the edge of the board. Such regions are **completely enclosed **by `'X'` cells.

 To capture a **surrounded region**, replace all `'O'`s with `'X'`s **in-place** within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

 **Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

 **Explanation:**

  In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** board = [["X"]]

 **Output:** [["X"]]

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.
