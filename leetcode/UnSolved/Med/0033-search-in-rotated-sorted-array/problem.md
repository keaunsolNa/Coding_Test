# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Binary Search

## Description

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

 Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly left rotated** at an unknown index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be left rotated by `3` indices and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

 Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of _`target`_ if it is in _`nums`_, or _`-1`_ if it is not in _`nums`.

 You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

 ```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

 ```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-104 <= target <= 104`
