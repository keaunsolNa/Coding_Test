# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

 A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

 - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

 **Example 2:**

  ```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
