# 2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Math, Greedy

## Description

You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer `1` and you want to reach the integer `target`.

 In one move, you can either:

 - **Increment** the current integer by one (i.e., `x = x + 1`).
- **Double** the current integer (i.e., `x = 2 * x`).

 You can use the **increment** operation **any** number of times, however, you can only use the **double** operation **at most** `maxDoubles` times.

 Given the two integers `target` and `maxDoubles`, return _the minimum number of moves needed to reach _`target`_ starting with _`1`.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: target = 5, maxDoubles = 0
Output: 4
Explanation: Keep incrementing by 1 until you reach target.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: target = 19, maxDoubles = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Initially, x = 1
Increment 3 times so x = 4
Double once so x = 8
Increment once so x = 9
Double again so x = 18
Increment once so x = 19
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: target = 10, maxDoubles = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: Initially, x = 1
Increment once so x = 2
Double once so x = 4
Increment once so x = 5
Double again so x = 10
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= target <= 109`
- `0 <= maxDoubles <= 100`
