# 3319. K-th Largest Perfect Subtree Size in Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Sorting, Binary Tree

## Description

You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** and an integer `k`.

 Return an integer denoting the size of the `kth` **largest_ _perfect binary**_ _subtree, or `-1` if it doesn't exist.

 A **perfect binary tree** is a tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** root = [5,3,6,5,2,5,7,1,8,null,null,6,8], k = 2

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 

 The roots of the perfect binary subtrees are highlighted in black. Their sizes, in non-increasing order are `[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
 The `2nd` largest size is 3.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 1

 **Output:** 7

 **Explanation:**

 

 The sizes of the perfect binary subtrees in non-increasing order are `[7, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The size of the largest perfect binary subtree is 7.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4], k = 3

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 

 The sizes of the perfect binary subtrees in non-increasing order are `[1, 1]`. There are fewer than 3 perfect binary subtrees.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 2000`
- `1 <= k <= 1024`
