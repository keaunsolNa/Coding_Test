# 3376. Minimum Time to Break Locks I

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, Breadth-First Search, Bitmask

## Description

Bob is stuck in a dungeon and must break `n` locks, each requiring some amount of **energy** to break. The required energy for each lock is stored in an array called `strength` where `strength[i]` indicates the energy needed to break the `ith` lock.

 To break a lock, Bob uses a sword with the following characteristics:

 - The initial energy of the sword is 0.
- The initial factor `x` by which the energy of the sword increases is 1.
- Every minute, the energy of the sword increases by the current factor `x`.
- To break the `ith` lock, the energy of the sword must reach **at least** `strength[i]`.
- After breaking a lock, the energy of the sword resets to 0, and the factor `x` increases by a given value `k`.

 Your task is to determine the **minimum** time in minutes required for Bob to break all `n` locks and escape the dungeon.

 Return the **minimum **time required for Bob to break all `n` locks.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** strength = [3,4,1], k = 1

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

    Time Energy x Action Updated x   0 0 1 Nothing 1   1 1 1 Break 3^rd Lock 2   2 2 2 Nothing 2   3 4 2 Break 2^nd Lock 3   4 3 3 Break 1^st Lock 3    The locks cannot be broken in less than 4 minutes; thus, the answer is 4.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** strength = [2,5,4], k = 2

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

    Time Energy x Action Updated x   0 0 1 Nothing 1   1 1 1 Nothing 1   2 2 1 Break 1^st Lock 3   3 3 3 Nothing 3   4 6 3 Break 2^n^d Lock 5   5 5 5 Break 3^r^d Lock 7    The locks cannot be broken in less than 5 minutes; thus, the answer is 5.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == strength.length`
- `1 <= n <= 8`
- `1 <= K <= 10`
- `1 <= strength[i] <= 106`
