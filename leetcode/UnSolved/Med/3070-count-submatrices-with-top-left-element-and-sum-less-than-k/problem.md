# 3070. Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than k

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Matrix, Prefix Sum

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`.

 Return _the **number** of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the_ `grid`, _and have a sum less than or equal to _`k`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
Output: 4
Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.
```

 **Example 2:**

  ```
Input: grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 20.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 109`
