# 2274. Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Sorting

## Description

Alice manages a company and has rented some floors of a building as office space. Alice has decided some of these floors should be **special floors**, used for relaxation only.

 You are given two integers `bottom` and `top`, which denote that Alice has rented all the floors from `bottom` to `top` (**inclusive**). You are also given the integer array `special`, where `special[i]` denotes a special floor that Alice has designated for relaxation.

 Return _the **maximum** number of consecutive floors without a special floor_.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: bottom = 2, top = 9, special = [4,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the ranges (inclusive) of consecutive floors without a special floor:
- (2, 3) with a total amount of 2 floors.
- (5, 5) with a total amount of 1 floor.
- (7, 9) with a total amount of 3 floors.
Therefore, we return the maximum number which is 3 floors.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: bottom = 6, top = 8, special = [7,6,8]
Output: 0
Explanation: Every floor rented is a special floor, so we return 0.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= special.length <= 105`
- `1 <= bottom <= special[i] <= top <= 109`
- All the values of `special` are **unique**.
