# 3566. Partition Array into Two Equal Product Subsets

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Bit Manipulation, Recursion, Enumeration

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` containing **distinct** positive integers and an integer `target`.

 Determine if you can partition `nums` into two **non-empty** **disjoint** **subsets**, with each element belonging to **exactly one** subset, such that the product of the elements in each subset is equal to `target`.

 Return `true` if such a partition exists and `false` otherwise.

 A **subset** of an array is a selection of elements of the array. 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [3,1,6,8,4], target = 24

 **Output:** true

 **Explanation:** The subsets `[3, 8]` and `[1, 6, 4]` each have a product of 24. Hence, the output is true.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,5,3,7], target = 15

 **Output:** false

 **Explanation:** There is no way to partition `nums` into two non-empty disjoint subsets such that both subsets have a product of 15. Hence, the output is false.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `3 <= nums.length <= 12`
- `1 <= target <= 1015`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- All elements of `nums` are **distinct**.
