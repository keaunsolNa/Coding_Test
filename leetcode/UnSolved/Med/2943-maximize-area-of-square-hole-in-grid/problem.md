# 2943. Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Sorting

## Description

You are given the two integers, `n` and `m` and two integer arrays, `hBars` and `vBars`. The grid has `n + 2` horizontal and `m + 2` vertical bars, creating 1 x 1 unit cells. The bars are indexed starting from `1`.

 You can **remove** some of the bars in `hBars` from horizontal bars and some of the bars in `vBars` from vertical bars. Note that other bars are fixed and cannot be removed.

 Return an integer denoting the **maximum area** of a _square-shaped_ hole in the grid, after removing some bars (possibly none).

 

 **Example 1:**

 

  **Input: **n = 2, m = 1, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2]

 **Output: **4

 **Explanation:**

 The left image shows the initial grid formed by the bars. The horizontal bars are `[1,2,3,4]`, and the vertical bars are `[1,2,3]`.

 One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.

  **Example 2:**

 

  **Input: **n = 1, m = 1, hBars = [2], vBars = [2]

 **Output: **4

 **Explanation:**

 To get the maximum square-shaped hole, we remove horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.

  **Example 3:**

 

  **Input: **n = 2, m = 3, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2,4]

 **Output: **4

 **Explanation:**

 One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 3, and vertical bar 4.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 109`
- `1 <= m <= 109`
- `1 <= hBars.length <= 100`
- `2 <= hBars[i] <= n + 1`
- `1 <= vBars.length <= 100`
- `2 <= vBars[i] <= m + 1`
- All values in `hBars` are distinct.
- All values in `vBars` are distinct.
