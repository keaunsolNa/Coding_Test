# 3738. Longest Non-Decreasing Subarray After Replacing at Most One Element

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

 You are allowed to replace **at most** one element in the array with any other integer value of your choice.

 Return the length of the **longest non-decreasing subarray** that can be obtained after performing at most one replacement.

 An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous one (if it exists).

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1,2]

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 Replacing `nums[3] = 1` with 3 gives the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 2].

 The longest non-decreasing subarray is [1, 2, 3, 3], which has a length of 4.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,2,2,2,2]

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 All elements in `nums` are equal, so it is already non-decreasing and the entire `nums` forms a subarray of length 5.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
