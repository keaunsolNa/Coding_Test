# 2672. Number of Adjacent Elements With the Same Color

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing an array `colors` of length `n` where all elements are set to 0's meaning **uncolored**. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [indexi, colori]`. For the `ith` **query**:

 - Set `colors[indexi]` to `colori`.
- Count the number of adjacent pairs in `colors` which have the same color (regardless of `colori`).

 Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `ith` query.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 4, queries = [[0,2],[1,2],[3,1],[1,1],[2,1]]

 **Output:** [0,1,1,0,2]

 **Explanation:**

 - Initially array colors = [0,0,0,0], where 0 denotes uncolored elements of the array.
- After the 1^st query colors = [2,0,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
- After the 2^nd query colors = [2,2,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
- After the 3^rd query colors = [2,2,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
- After the 4^th query colors = [2,1,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
- After the 5^th query colors = [2,1,1,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 2.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 1, queries = [[0,100000]]

 **Output:** [0]

 **Explanation:**

 After the 1^st query colors = [100000]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= indexi <= n - 1`
- `1 <= colori <= 105`
