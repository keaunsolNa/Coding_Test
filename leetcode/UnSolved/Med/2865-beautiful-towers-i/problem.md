# 2865. Beautiful Towers I

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Stack, Monotonic Stack

## Description

You are given an array `heights` of `n` integers representing the number of bricks in `n` consecutive towers. Your task is to remove some bricks to form a **mountain-shaped** tower arrangement. In this arrangement, the tower heights are non-decreasing, reaching a maximum peak value with one or multiple consecutive towers and then non-increasing.

 Return the **maximum possible sum** of heights of a mountain-shaped tower arrangement.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** heights = [5,3,4,1,1]

 **Output:** 13

 **Explanation:**

 We remove some bricks to make `heights = [5,3,3,1,1]`, the peak is at index 0.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** heights = [6,5,3,9,2,7]

 **Output:** 22

 **Explanation:**

 We remove some bricks to make `heights = [3,3,3,9,2,2]`, the peak is at index 3.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** heights = [3,2,5,5,2,3]

 **Output:** 18

 **Explanation:**

 We remove some bricks to make `heights = [2,2,5,5,2,2]`, the peak is at index 2 or 3.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == heights.length <= 103`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 109`
