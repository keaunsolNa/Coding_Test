# 1861. Rotating the Box

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Two Pointers, Matrix

## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `boxGrid` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:

 - A stone `'#'`
- A stationary obstacle `'*'`
- Empty `'.'`

 The box is rotated **90 degrees clockwise**, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity **does not** affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation **does not **affect the stones' horizontal positions.

 It is **guaranteed** that each stone in `boxGrid` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

 Return _an _`n x m`_ matrix representing the box after the rotation described above_.

 

 **Example 1:**

 

 ```
Input: boxGrid = [["#",".","#"]]
Output: [["."],
         ["#"],
         ["#"]]
```

 **Example 2:**

 

 ```
Input: boxGrid = [["#",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","*","."]]
Output: [["#","."],
         ["#","#"],
         ["*","*"],
         [".","."]]
```

 **Example 3:**

 

 ```
Input: boxGrid = [["#","#","*",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
              ["#","#","#",".","#","."]]
Output: [[".","#","#"],
         [".","#","#"],
         ["#","#","*"],
         ["#","*","."],
         ["#",".","*"],
         ["#",".","."]]
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == boxGrid.length`
- `n == boxGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `boxGrid[i][j]` is either `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.
