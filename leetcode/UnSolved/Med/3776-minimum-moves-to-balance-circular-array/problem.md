# 3776. Minimum Moves to Balance Circular Array

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting

## Description

You are given a **circular** array `balance` of length `n`, where `balance[i]` is the net balance of person `i`.

 In one move, a person can transfer **exactly** 1 unit of balance to either their left or right neighbor.

 Return the **minimum** number of moves required so that every person has a **non-negative** balance. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

 **Note**: You are guaranteed that **at most** 1 index has a **negative** balance initially.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** balance = [5,1,-4]

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 One optimal sequence of moves is:

 - Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [5, 0, -3]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [4, 0, -2]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [3, 0, -1]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [2, 0, 0]`

 Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 4.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** balance = [1,2,-5,2]

 **Output:** 6

 **Explanation:**

 One optimal sequence of moves is:

 - Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 1, -4, 2]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 0, -3, 2]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 3` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 0, -2, 1]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 3` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 0, -1, 0]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 1`, resulting in `balance = [0, 1, -1, 0]`
- Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [0, 0, 0, 0]`

 Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 6.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** balance = [-3,2]

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 ****It is impossible to make all balances non-negative for `balance = [-3, 2]`, so the answer is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == balance.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= balance[i] <= 109`
- There is at most one negative value in `balance` initially.
