# 3619. Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union-Find, Matrix

## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` and a positive integer `k`. An **island** is a group of **positive** integers (representing land) that are **4-directionally** connected (horizontally or vertically).

 The **total value** of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the island.

 Return the number of islands with a total value **divisible by** `k`.

 

 **Example 1:**

   **Input:** grid = [[0,2,1,0,0],[0,5,0,0,5],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,4,7,0],[0,2,0,0,8]], k = 5

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 The grid contains four islands. The islands highlighted in blue have a total value that is divisible by 5, while the islands highlighted in red do not.

  **Example 2:**

   **Input:** grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]], k = 3

 **Output:** 6

 **Explanation:**

 The grid contains six islands, each with a total value that is divisible by 3.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m * n <= 105`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 106`
- `1 <= k <= 106`
