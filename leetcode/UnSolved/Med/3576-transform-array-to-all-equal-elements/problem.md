# 3576. Transform Array to All Equal Elements

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Greedy

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` containing only `1` and `-1`, and an integer `k`.

 You can perform the following operation at most `k` times:

 - Choose an index `i` (`0 <= i < n - 1`), and **multiply** both `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` by `-1`.

 **Note** that you can choose the same index `i` more than once in **different** operations.

 Return `true` if it is possible to make all elements of the array **equal** after at most `k` operations, and `false` otherwise.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,-1,1,-1,1], k = 3

 **Output:** true

 **Explanation:**

 We can make all elements in the array equal in 2 operations as follows:

 - Choose index `i = 1`, and multiply both `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` by -1. Now `nums = [1,1,-1,-1,1]`.
- Choose index `i = 2`, and multiply both `nums[2]` and `nums[3]` by -1. Now `nums = [1,1,1,1,1]`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [-1,-1,-1,1,1,1], k = 5

 **Output:** false

 **Explanation:**

 It is not possible to make all array elements equal in at most 5 operations.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]` is either -1 or 1.
- `1 <= k <= n`
