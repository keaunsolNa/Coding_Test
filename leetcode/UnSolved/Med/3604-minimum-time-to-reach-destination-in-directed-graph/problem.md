# 3604. Minimum Time to Reach Destination in Directed Graph

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and a **directed** graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, starti, endi]` indicates an edge from node `ui` to `vi` that can **only** be used at any integer time `t` such that `starti <= t <= endi`.

 You start at node 0 at time 0.

 In one unit of time, you can either:

 - Wait at your current node without moving, or
- Travel along an outgoing edge from your current node if the current time `t` satisfies `starti <= t <= endi`.

 Return the **minimum** time required to reach node `n - 1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,0,1],[1,2,2,5]]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 

 The optimal path is:

 - At time `t = 0`, take the edge `(0 → 1)` which is available from 0 to 1. You arrive at node 1 at time `t = 1`, then wait until `t = 2`.
- At time `t = 2`, take the edge `(1 → 2)` which is available from 2 to 5. You arrive at node 2 at time 3.

 Hence, the minimum time to reach node 2 is 3.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,0,3],[1,3,7,8],[0,2,1,5],[2,3,4,7]]

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 

 The optimal path is:

 - Wait at node 0 until time `t = 1`, then take the edge `(0 → 2)` which is available from 1 to 5. You arrive at node 2 at `t = 2`.
- Wait at node 2 until time `t = 4`, then take the edge `(2 → 3)` which is available from 4 to 7. You arrive at node 3 at `t = 5`.

 Hence, the minimum time to reach node 3 is 5.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[1,0,1,3],[1,2,3,5]]

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 

 - Since there is no outgoing edge from node 0, it is impossible to reach node 2. Hence, the output is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 105`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi, starti, endi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 109`
