# 3462. Maximum Sum With at Most K Elements

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Matrix

## Description

You are given a 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n x m`, an integer array `limits` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. The task is to find the **maximum sum** of **at most** `k` elements from the matrix `grid` such that:

 - The number of elements taken from the `ith` row of `grid` does not exceed `limits[i]`.

 Return the **maximum sum**.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], limits = [1,2], k = 2

 **Output:** 7

 **Explanation:**

 - From the second row, we can take at most 2 elements. The elements taken are 4 and 3.
- The maximum possible sum of at most 2 selected elements is `4 + 3 = 7`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** grid = [[5,3,7],[8,2,6]], limits = [2,2], k = 3

 **Output:** 21

 **Explanation:**

 - From the first row, we can take at most 2 elements. The element taken is 7.
- From the second row, we can take at most 2 elements. The elements taken are 8 and 6.
- The maximum possible sum of at most 3 selected elements is `7 + 8 + 6 = 21`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == grid.length == limits.length`
- `m == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 500`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`
- `0 <= limits[i] <= m`
- `0 <= k <= min(n * m, sum(limits))`
