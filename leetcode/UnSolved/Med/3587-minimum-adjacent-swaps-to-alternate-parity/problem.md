# 3587. Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Alternate Parity

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Greedy

## Description

You are given an array `nums` of **distinct** integers.

 In one operation, you can swap any two **adjacent** elements in the array.

 An arrangement of the array is considered **valid** if the parity of adjacent elements **alternates**, meaning every pair of neighboring elements consists of one even and one odd number.

 Return the **minimum** number of adjacent swaps required to transform `nums` into any valid arrangement.

 If it is impossible to rearrange `nums` such that no two adjacent elements have the same parity, return `-1`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,4,6,5,7]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 Swapping 5 and 6, the array becomes `[2,4,5,6,7]`

 Swapping 5 and 4, the array becomes `[2,5,4,6,7]`

 Swapping 6 and 7, the array becomes `[2,5,4,7,6]`. The array is now a valid arrangement. Thus, the answer is 3.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,4,5,7]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 By swapping 4 and 5, the array becomes `[2,5,4,7]`, which is a valid arrangement. Thus, the answer is 1.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,2,3]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 The array is already a valid arrangement. Thus, no operations are needed.

  **Example 4:**

  **Input:** nums = [4,5,6,8]

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 No valid arrangement is possible. Thus, the answer is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- All elements in `nums` are **distinct**.
