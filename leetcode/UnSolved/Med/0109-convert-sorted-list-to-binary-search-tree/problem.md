# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Linked List, Divide and Conquer, Tree, Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree

## Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert _it to a _**_height-balanced_** _binary search tree_.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
