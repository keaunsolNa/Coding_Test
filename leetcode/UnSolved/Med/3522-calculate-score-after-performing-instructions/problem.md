# 3522. Calculate Score After Performing Instructions

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, String, Simulation

## Description

You are given two arrays, `instructions` and `values`, both of size `n`.

 You need to simulate a process based on the following rules:

 - You start at the first instruction at index `i = 0` with an initial score of 0.
- If `instructions[i]` is `"add"`: - Add `values[i]` to your score.
- Move to the next instruction `(i + 1)`.
- If `instructions[i]` is `"jump"`: - Move to the instruction at index `(i + values[i])` without modifying your score.

 The process ends when you either:

 - Go out of bounds (i.e., `i < 0 or i >= n`), or
- Attempt to revisit an instruction that has been previously executed. The revisited instruction is not executed.

 Return your score at the end of the process.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** instructions = ["jump","add","add","jump","add","jump"], values = [2,1,3,1,-2,-3]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 Simulate the process starting at instruction 0:

 - At index 0: Instruction is `"jump"`, move to index `0 + 2 = 2`.
- At index 2: Instruction is `"add"`, add `values[2] = 3` to your score and move to index 3. Your score becomes 3.
- At index 3: Instruction is `"jump"`, move to index `3 + 1 = 4`.
- At index 4: Instruction is `"add"`, add `values[4] = -2` to your score and move to index 5. Your score becomes 1.
- At index 5: Instruction is `"jump"`, move to index `5 + (-3) = 2`.
- At index 2: Already visited. The process ends.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** instructions = ["jump","add","add"], values = [3,1,1]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 Simulate the process starting at instruction 0:

 - At index 0: Instruction is `"jump"`, move to index `0 + 3 = 3`.
- At index 3: Out of bounds. The process ends.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** instructions = ["jump"], values = [0]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 Simulate the process starting at instruction 0:

 - At index 0: Instruction is `"jump"`, move to index `0 + 0 = 0`.
- At index 0: Already visited. The process ends.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == instructions.length == values.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `instructions[i]` is either `"add"` or `"jump"`.
- `-105 <= values[i] <= 105`
