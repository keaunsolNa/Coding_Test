# 3613. Minimize Maximum Component Cost

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Binary Search, Union-Find, Graph Theory, Sorting

## Description

You are given an undirected connected graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1` and a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` denotes an undirected edge between node `ui` and node `vi` with weight `wi`, and an integer `k`.

 You are allowed to remove any number of edges from the graph such that the resulting graph has **at most** `k` connected components.

 The **cost** of a component is defined as the **maximum** edge weight in that component. If a component has no edges, its cost is 0.

 Return the **minimum** possible value of the **maximum** cost among all components **after such removals**.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[3,4,6]], k = 2

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 

 - Remove the edge between nodes 3 and 4 (weight 6).
- The resulting components have costs of 0 and 4, so the overall maximum cost is 4.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5]], k = 1

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 

 - No edge can be removed, since allowing only one component (`k = 1`) requires the graph to stay fully connected.
- That single component’s cost equals its largest edge weight, which is 5.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 105`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
- `1 <= wi <= 106`
- `1 <= k <= n`
- The input graph is connected.
