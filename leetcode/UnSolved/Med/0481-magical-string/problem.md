# 481. Magical String

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Two Pointers, String

## Description

A magical string `s` consists of only `'1'` and `'2'` and obeys the following rule:

 - Concatenating the sequence of lengths of its consecutive groups of identical characters `'1'` and `'2'` generates the string `s` itself.

 The first few elements of `s` is `s = "1221121221221121122……"`. If we group the consecutive `1`'s and `2`'s in `s`, it will be `"1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......"` and counting the occurrences of `1`'s or `2`'s in each group yields the sequence `"1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......"`.

 You can see that concatenating the occurrence sequence gives us `s` itself.

 Given an integer `n`, return the number of `1`'s in the first `n` number in the magical string `s`.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string s is "122112" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 105`
