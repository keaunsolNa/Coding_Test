# 3627. Maximum Median Sum of Subsequences of Size 3

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Math, Greedy, Sorting, Game Theory

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` with a length divisible by 3.

 You want to make the array empty in steps. In each step, you can select any three elements from the array, compute their **median**, and remove the selected elements from the array.

 The **median** of an odd-length sequence is defined as the middle element of the sequence when it is sorted in non-decreasing order.

 Return the **maximum** possible sum of the medians computed from the selected elements.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,1,3,2,1,3]

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 - In the first step, select elements at indices 2, 4, and 5, which have a median 3. After removing these elements, `nums` becomes `[2, 1, 2]`.
- In the second step, select elements at indices 0, 1, and 2, which have a median 2. After removing these elements, `nums` becomes empty.

 Hence, the sum of the medians is `3 + 2 = 5`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,1,10,10,10,10]

 **Output:** 20

 **Explanation:**

 - In the first step, select elements at indices 0, 2, and 3, which have a median 10. After removing these elements, `nums` becomes `[1, 10, 10]`.
- In the second step, select elements at indices 0, 1, and 2, which have a median 10. After removing these elements, `nums` becomes empty.

 Hence, the sum of the medians is `10 + 10 = 20`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105`
- `nums.length % 3 == 0`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
