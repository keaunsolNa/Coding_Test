# 2342. Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers. You can choose two indices `i` and `j`, such that `i != j`, and the sum of digits of the number `nums[i]` is equal to that of `nums[j]`.

 Return the **maximum** value of_ _`nums[i] + nums[j]`_ _that you can obtain over all possible indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions. If no such pair of indices exists, return -1.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
Output: 54
Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
- (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
- (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
