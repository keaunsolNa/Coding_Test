# 3746. Minimum String Length After Balanced Removals

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** String, Stack, Counting

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'a'` and `'b'`.

 You are allowed to repeatedly remove **any substring** where the number of `'a'` characters is equal to the number of `'b'` characters. After each removal, the remaining parts of the string are concatenated together without gaps.

 Return an integer denoting the **minimum possible length** of the string after performing any number of such operations.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = `"aabbab"`

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 The substring `"aabbab"` has three `'a'` and three `'b'`. Since their counts are equal, we can remove the entire string directly. The minimum length is 0.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = `"aaaa"`

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 Every substring of `"aaaa"` contains only `'a'` characters. No substring can be removed as a result, so the minimum length remains 4.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = `"aaabb"`

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 First, remove the substring `"ab"`, leaving `"aab"`. Next, remove the new substring `"ab"`, leaving `"a"`. No further removals are possible, so the minimum length is 1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is either `'a'` or `'b'`.
