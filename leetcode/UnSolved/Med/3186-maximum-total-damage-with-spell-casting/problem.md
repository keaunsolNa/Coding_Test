# 3186. Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Counting

## Description

A magician has various spells.

 You are given an array `power`, where each element represents the damage of a spell. Multiple spells can have the same damage value.

 It is a known fact that if a magician decides to cast a spell with a damage of `power[i]`, they **cannot** cast any spell with a damage of `power[i] - 2`, `power[i] - 1`, `power[i] + 1`, or `power[i] + 2`.

 Each spell can be cast **only once**.

 Return the **maximum** possible _total damage_ that a magician can cast.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** power = [1,1,3,4]

 **Output:** 6

 **Explanation:**

 The maximum possible damage of 6 is produced by casting spells 0, 1, 3 with damage 1, 1, 4.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** power = [7,1,6,6]

 **Output:** 13

 **Explanation:**

 The maximum possible damage of 13 is produced by casting spells 1, 2, 3 with damage 1, 6, 6.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= power.length <= 105`
- `1 <= power[i] <= 109`
