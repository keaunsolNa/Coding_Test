# 3419. Minimize the Maximum Edge Weight of Graph

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Shortest Path

## Description

You are given two integers, `n` and `threshold`, as well as a **directed** weighted graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a **2D** integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [Ai, Bi, Wi]` indicates that there is an edge going from node `Ai` to node `Bi` with weight `Wi`.

 You have to remove some edges from this graph (possibly **none**), so that it satisfies the following conditions:

 - Node 0 must be reachable from all other nodes.
- The **maximum** edge weight in the resulting graph is **minimized**.
- Each node has **at most** `threshold` outgoing edges.

 Return the **minimum** possible value of the **maximum** edge weight after removing the necessary edges. If it is impossible for all conditions to be satisfied, return -1.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,0,1],[2,0,2],[3,0,1],[4,3,1],[2,1,1]], threshold = 2

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 

 Remove the edge `2 -> 0`. The maximum weight among the remaining edges is 1.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[0,2,2],[0,3,1],[0,4,1],[1,2,1],[1,4,1]], threshold = 1

 **Output:** -1

 **Explanation:**

 It is impossible to reach node 0 from node 2.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,2,1],[1,3,3],[1,4,5],[2,3,2],[3,4,2],[4,0,1]], threshold = 1

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 

 Remove the edges `1 -> 3` and `1 -> 4`. The maximum weight among the remaining edges is 2.

  **Example 4:**

  **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,2,1],[1,3,3],[1,4,5],[2,3,2],[4,0,1]], threshold = 1

 **Output:** -1

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= threshold <= n - 1`
- `1 <= edges.length <= min(105, n * (n - 1) / 2).`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= Ai, Bi < n`
- `Ai != Bi`
- `1 <= Wi <= 106`
- There **may be** multiple edges between a pair of nodes, but they must have unique weights.
