# 3881. Direction Assignments with Exactly K Visible People

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Math, Combinatorics

## Description

You are given three integers `n`, `pos`, and `k`.

 There are `n` people standing in a line indexed from 0 to `n - 1`. Each person **independently** chooses a direction:

 - `'L'`: **visible** only to people on their **right**
- `'R'`: **visible** only to people on their **left**

 A person at index `pos` sees others as follows: - A person `i < pos` is visible if and only if they choose `'L'`.
- A person `i > pos` is visible if and only if they choose `'R'`.

 Return the number of possible direction assignments such that the person at index `pos` sees **exactly** `k` people.

 Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 3, pos = 1, k = 0

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - Index 0 is to the left of `pos = 1`, and index 2 is to the right of `pos = 1`.
- To see `k = 0` people, index 0 must choose `'R'` and index 2 must choose `'L'`, keeping both invisible.
- The person at index 1 can choose `'L'` or `'R'` since it does not affect the count. Thus, the answer is 2.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 3, pos = 2, k = 1

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 - Index 0 and index 1 are left of `pos = 2`, and there is no index to the right.
- To see `k = 1` person, exactly one of index 0 or index 1 must choose `'L'`, and the other must choose `'R'`.
- There are 2 ways to choose which index is visible from the left.
- The person at index 2 can choose `'L'` or `'R'` since it does not affect the count. Thus, the answer is `2 + 2 = 4`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 1, pos = 0, k = 0

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - There are no indices to the left or right of `pos = 0`.
- To see `k = 0` people, no additional condition is required.
- The person at index 0 can choose `'L'` or `'R'`. Thus, the answer is 2.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= pos, k <= n - 1`
