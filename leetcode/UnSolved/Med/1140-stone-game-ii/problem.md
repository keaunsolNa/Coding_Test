# 1140. Stone Game II

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Math, Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum, Game Theory

## Description

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

 Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.

 On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the **first** `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`. Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`. Initially, M = 1.

 The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

 Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** piles = [2,7,9,4,4]

 **Output:** 10

 **Explanation:**

 - If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get `2 + 4 + 4 = 10` stones in total.
- If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get `2 + 7 = 9` stones in total.

 So we return 10 since it's larger.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** piles = [1,2,3,4,5,100]

 **Output:** 104

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= piles.length <= 100`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`
