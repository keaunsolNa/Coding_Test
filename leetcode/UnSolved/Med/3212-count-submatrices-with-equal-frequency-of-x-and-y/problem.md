# 3212. Count Submatrices With Equal Frequency of X and Y

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Matrix, Prefix Sum

## Description

Given a 2D character matrix `grid`, where `grid[i][j]` is either `'X'`, `'Y'`, or `'.'`, return the number of submatrices that contain:

 - `grid[0][0]`
- an **equal** frequency of `'X'` and `'Y'`.
- **at least** one `'X'`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** grid = [["X","Y","."],["Y",".","."]]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 ****

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** grid = [["X","X"],["X","Y"]]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 No submatrix has an equal frequency of `'X'` and `'Y'`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** grid = [[".","."],[".","."]]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 No submatrix has at least one `'X'`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `'X'`, `'Y'`, or `'.'`.
