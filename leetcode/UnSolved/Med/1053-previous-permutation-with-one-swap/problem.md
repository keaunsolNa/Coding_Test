# 1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Greedy

## Description

Given an array of positive integers `arr` (not necessarily distinct), return _the __lexicographically__ largest permutation that is smaller than_ `arr`, that can be **made with exactly one swap**. If it cannot be done, then return the same array.

 **Note** that a _swap_ exchanges the positions of two numbers `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: arr = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]
Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: arr = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,1,5]
Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
```

 **Example 3:**

 ```
Input: arr = [1,9,4,6,7]
Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 104`
