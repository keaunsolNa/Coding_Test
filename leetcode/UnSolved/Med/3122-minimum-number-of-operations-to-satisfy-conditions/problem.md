# 3122. Minimum Number of Operations to Satisfy Conditions

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Matrix

## Description

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n`. In one **operation**, you can change the value of **any** cell to **any** non-negative number. You need to perform some **operations** such that each cell `grid[i][j]` is:

 - Equal to the cell below it, i.e. `grid[i][j] == grid[i + 1][j]` (if it exists).
- Different from the cell to its right, i.e. `grid[i][j] != grid[i][j + 1]` (if it exists).

 Return the **minimum** number of operations needed.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,0,2],[1,0,2]]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 ****

 All the cells in the matrix already satisfy the properties.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 ****

 The matrix becomes `[[1,0,1],[1,0,1]]` which satisfies the properties, by doing these 3 operations:

 - Change `grid[1][0]` to 1.
- Change `grid[0][1]` to 0.
- Change `grid[1][2]` to 1.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1],[2],[3]]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 

 There is a single column. We can change the value to 1 in each cell using 2 operations.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 9`
