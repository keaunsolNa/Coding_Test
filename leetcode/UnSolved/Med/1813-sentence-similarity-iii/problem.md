# 1813. Sentence Similarity III

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Two Pointers, String

## Description

You are given two strings `sentence1` and `sentence2`, each representing a **sentence** composed of words. A sentence is a list of **words** that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase English characters.

 Two sentences `s1` and `s2` are considered **similar** if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (_possibly empty_) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. **Note** that the inserted sentence must be separated from existing words by spaces.

 For example,

 - `s1 = "Hello Jane"` and `s2 = "Hello my name is Jane"` can be made equal by inserting `"my name is"` between `"Hello"` and `"Jane"` in s1.
- `s1 = "Frog cool"` and `s2 = "Frogs are cool"` are **not** similar, since although there is a sentence `"s are"` inserted into `s1`, it is not separated from `"Frog"` by a space.

 Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return **true** if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are **similar**. Otherwise, return **false**.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** sentence1 = "My name is Haley", sentence2 = "My Haley"

 **Output:** true

 **Explanation:**

 `sentence2` can be turned to `sentence1` by inserting "name is" between "My" and "Haley".

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** sentence1 = "of", sentence2 = "A lot of words"

 **Output:** false

 **Explanation:**

 No single sentence can be inserted inside one of the sentences to make it equal to the other.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** sentence1 = "Eating right now", sentence2 = "Eating"

 **Output:** true

 **Explanation:**

 `sentence2` can be turned to `sentence1` by inserting "right now" at the end of the sentence.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 100`
- `sentence1` and `sentence2` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
- The words in `sentence1` and `sentence2` are separated by a single space.
