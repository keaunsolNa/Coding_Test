# 1901. Find a Peak Element II

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Binary Search, Matrix

## Description

A **peak** element in a 2D grid is an element that is **strictly greater** than all of its **adjacent **neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

 Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `mat` where **no two adjacent cells are equal**, find **any** peak element `mat[i][j]` and return _the length 2 array _`[i,j]`.

 You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an **outer perimeter** with the value `-1` in each cell.

 You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(m log(n))` or `O(n log(m))` time.

 

 **Example 1:**

 

 ```
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ****

 ```
Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105`
- No two adjacent cells are equal.
