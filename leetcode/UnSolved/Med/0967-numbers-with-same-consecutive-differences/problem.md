# 967. Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Backtracking, Breadth-First Search

## Description

Given two integers n and k, return _an array of all the integers of length _`n`_ where the difference between every two consecutive digits is _`k`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 Note that the integers should not have leading zeros. Integers as `02` and `043` are not allowed.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: n = 3, k = 7
Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= n <= 9`
- `0 <= k <= 9`
