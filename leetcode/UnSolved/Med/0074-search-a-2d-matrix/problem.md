# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Binary Search, Matrix

## Description

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

 - Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

 Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

 You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

 **Example 2:**

  ```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104`
