# 3714. Longest Balanced Substring II

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Hash Table, String, Prefix Sum

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

 A **substring** of `s` is called **balanced** if all **distinct** characters in the **substring** appear the **same** number of times.

 Return the **length of the longest balanced substring** of `s`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "abbac"

 **Output:** 4

 **Explanation:**

 The longest balanced substring is `"abba"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 2 times.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "aabcc"

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 The longest balanced substring is `"abc"` because all distinct characters `'a'`, `'b'` and `'c'` each appear exactly 1 time.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "aba"

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 One of the longest balanced substrings is `"ab"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 1 time. Another longest balanced substring is `"ba"`.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` contains only the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
