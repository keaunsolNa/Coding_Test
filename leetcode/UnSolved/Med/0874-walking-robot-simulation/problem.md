# 874. Walking Robot Simulation

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Simulation

## Description

A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point `(0, 0)` facing north. The robot receives an array of integers `commands`, which represents a sequence of moves that it needs to execute. There are only three possible types of instructions the robot can receive:

 - `-2`: Turn left `90` degrees.
- `-1`: Turn right `90` degrees.
- `1 <= k <= 9`: Move forward `k` units, one unit at a time.

 Some of the grid squares are `obstacles`. The `ith` obstacle is at grid point `obstacles[i] = (xi, yi)`. If the robot runs into an obstacle, it will stay in its current location (on the block adjacent to the obstacle) and move onto the next command.

 Return the **maximum squared Euclidean distance** that the robot reaches at any point in its path (i.e. if the distance is `5`, return `25`).

 **Note:**

 - There can be an obstacle at `(0, 0)`. If this happens, the robot will ignore the obstacle until it has moved off the origin. However, it will be unable to return to `(0, 0)` due to the obstacle.
- North means +Y direction.
- East means +X direction.
- South means -Y direction.
- West means -X direction.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []

 **Output:** 25

 **Explanation: **

 The robot starts at `(0, 0)`:

 1. Move north 4 units to `(0, 4)`.
2. Turn right.
3. Move east 3 units to `(3, 4)`.

 The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is `(3, 4)`, which squared is `32 + 42 = 25` units away.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4], obstacles = [[2,4]]

 **Output:** 65

 **Explanation:**

 The robot starts at `(0, 0)`:

 1. Move north 4 units to `(0, 4)`.
2. Turn right.
3. Move east 1 unit and get blocked by the obstacle at `(2, 4)`, robot is at `(1, 4)`.
4. Turn left.
5. Move north 4 units to `(1, 8)`.

 The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is `(1, 8)`, which squared is `12 + 82 = 65` units away.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** commands = [6,-1,-1,6], obstacles = [[0,0]]

 **Output:** 36

 **Explanation:**

 The robot starts at `(0, 0)`:

 1. Move north 6 units to `(0, 6)`.
2. Turn right.
3. Turn right.
4. Move south 5 units and get blocked by the obstacle at `(0,0)`, robot is at `(0, 1)`.

 The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is `(0, 6)`, which squared is `62 = 36` units away.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= commands.length <= 104`
- `commands[i]` is either `-2`, `-1`, or an integer in the range `[1, 9]`.
- `0 <= obstacles.length <= 104`
- `-3 * 104 <= xi, yi <= 3 * 104`
- The answer is guaranteed to be less than `231`.
