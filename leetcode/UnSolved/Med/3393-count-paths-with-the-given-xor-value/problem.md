# 3393. Count Paths With the Given XOR Value

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Matrix

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` with size `m x n`. You are also given an integer `k`.

 Your task is to calculate the number of paths you can take from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` satisfying the following **constraints**:

 - You can either move to the right or down. Formally, from the cell `(i, j)` you may move to the cell `(i, j + 1)` or to the cell `(i + 1, j)` if the target cell _exists_.
- The `XOR` of all the numbers on the path must be **equal** to `k`.

 Return the total number of such paths.

 Since the answer can be very large, return the result **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** grid = [[2, 1, 5], [7, 10, 0], [12, 6, 4]], k = 11

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 The 3 paths are:

 - `(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2)`
- `(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2)`
- `(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2)`

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1, 3, 3, 3], [0, 3, 3, 2], [3, 0, 1, 1]], k = 2

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 The 5 paths are:

 - `(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (2, 3)`
- `(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (2, 3)`
- `(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3)`
- `(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3)`
- `(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3)`

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** grid = [[1, 1, 1, 2], [3, 0, 3, 2], [3, 0, 2, 2]], k = 10

 **Output:** 0

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= m == grid.length <= 300`
- `1 <= n == grid[r].length <= 300`
- `0 <= grid[r][c] < 16`
- `0 <= k < 16`
