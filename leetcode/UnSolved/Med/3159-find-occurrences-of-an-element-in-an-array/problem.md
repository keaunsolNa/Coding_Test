# 3159. Find Occurrences of an Element in an Array

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer array `queries`, and an integer `x`.

 For each `queries[i]`, you need to find the index of the `queries[i]th` occurrence of `x` in the `nums` array. If there are fewer than `queries[i]` occurrences of `x`, the answer should be -1 for that query.

 Return an integer array `answer` containing the answers to all queries.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,3,1,7], queries = [1,3,2,4], x = 1

 **Output:** [0,-1,2,-1]

 **Explanation:**

 - For the 1^st query, the first occurrence of 1 is at index 0.
- For the 2^nd query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in `nums`, so the answer is -1.
- For the 3^rd query, the second occurrence of 1 is at index 2.
- For the 4^th query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in `nums`, so the answer is -1.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,2,3], queries = [10], x = 5

 **Output:** [-1]

 **Explanation:**

 - For the 1^st query, 5 doesn't exist in `nums`, so the answer is -1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 105`
- `1 <= queries[i] <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i], x <= 104`
