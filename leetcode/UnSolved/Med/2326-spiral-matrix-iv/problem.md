# 2326. Spiral Matrix IV

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Linked List, Matrix, Simulation

## Description

You are given two integers `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.

 You are also given the `head` of a linked list of integers.

 Generate an `m x n` matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in **spiral** order **(clockwise)**, starting from the **top-left** of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with `-1`.

 Return _the generated matrix_.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
Output: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.
```

 **Example 2:**

  ```
Input: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]
Output: [[0,1,2,-1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.
The last space in the matrix is set to -1.
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `1 <= m * n <= 105`
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, m * n]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
