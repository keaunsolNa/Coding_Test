# 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of its children is `2`, and so on.

 Return the **smallest** level `x` such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level `x` is **maximal**.

 

 **Example 1:**

  ```
Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
Output: 2
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
