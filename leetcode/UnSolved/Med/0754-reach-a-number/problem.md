# 754. Reach a Number

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Math, Binary Search

## Description

You are standing at position `0` on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position `target`.

 You can make some number of moves `numMoves` so that:

 - On each move, you can either go left or right.
- During the `ith` move (starting from `i == 1` to `i == numMoves`), you take `i` steps in the chosen direction.

 Given the integer `target`, return _the **minimum** number of moves required (i.e., the minimum _`numMoves`_) to reach the destination_.

 

 **Example 1:**

 ```
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).
```

 **Example 2:**

 ```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).
```

 

 **Constraints:**

 - `-109 <= target <= 109`
- `target != 0`
