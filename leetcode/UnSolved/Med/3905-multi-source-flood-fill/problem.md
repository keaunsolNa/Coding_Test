# 3905. Multi Source Flood Fill

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** 

## Description

You are given two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of rows and columns of a grid, respectively.

 You are also given a 2D integer array `sources`, where `sources[i] = [ri, ci, colori]` indicates that the cell `(ri, ci)` is initially colored with `colori`. All other cells are initially uncolored and represented as 0.

 At each time step, every currently colored cell spreads its color to all adjacent **uncolored** cells in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. All spreads happen simultaneously.

 If **multiple** colors reach the same uncolored cell at the same time step, the cell takes the color with the **maximum** value.

 The process continues until no more cells can be colored.

 Return a 2D integer array representing the final state of the grid, where each cell contains its final color.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** n = 3, m = 3, sources = [[0,0,1],[2,2,2]]

 **Output:** [[1,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,2,2]]

 **Explanation:**

 The grid at each time step is as follows:

 

 At time step 2, cells `(0, 2)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 0)` are reached by both colors, so they are assigned color 2 as it has the maximum value among them.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** n = 3, m = 3, sources = [[0,1,3],[1,1,5]]

 **Output:** [[3,3,3],[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]

 **Explanation:**

 The grid at each time step is as follows:

 

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** n = 2, m = 2, sources = [[1,1,5]]

 **Output:** [[5,5],[5,5]]

 **Explanation:**

 The grid at each time step is as follows:

 

 Since there is only one source, all cells are assigned the same color.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n, m <= 105`
- `1 <= n * m <= 105`
- `1 <= sources.length <= n * m`
- `sources[i] = [ri, ci, colori]`
- `0 <= ri <= n - 1`
- `0 <= ci <= m - 1`
- `1 <= colori <= 106`
- All `(ri, ci)` in `sources` are distinct.
