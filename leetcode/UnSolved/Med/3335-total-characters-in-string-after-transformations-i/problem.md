# 3335. Total Characters in String After Transformations I

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Hash Table, Math, String, Dynamic Programming, Counting

## Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `t`, representing the number of **transformations** to perform. In one **transformation**, every character in `s` is replaced according to the following rules:

 - If the character is `'z'`, replace it with the string `"ab"`.
- Otherwise, replace it with the **next** character in the alphabet. For example, `'a'` is replaced with `'b'`, `'b'` is replaced with `'c'`, and so on.

 Return the **length** of the resulting string after **exactly** `t` transformations.

 Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "abcyy", t = 2

 **Output:** 7

 **Explanation:**

 - **First Transformation (t = 1)**: - `'a'` becomes `'b'`
- `'b'` becomes `'c'`
- `'c'` becomes `'d'`
- `'y'` becomes `'z'`
- `'y'` becomes `'z'`
- String after the first transformation: `"bcdzz"`
- **Second Transformation (t = 2)**: - `'b'` becomes `'c'`
- `'c'` becomes `'d'`
- `'d'` becomes `'e'`
- `'z'` becomes `"ab"`
- `'z'` becomes `"ab"`
- String after the second transformation: `"cdeabab"`
- **Final Length of the string**: The string is `"cdeabab"`, which has 7 characters.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "azbk", t = 1

 **Output:** 5

 **Explanation:**

 - **First Transformation (t = 1)**: - `'a'` becomes `'b'`
- `'z'` becomes `"ab"`
- `'b'` becomes `'c'`
- `'k'` becomes `'l'`
- String after the first transformation: `"babcl"`
- **Final Length of the string**: The string is `"babcl"`, which has 5 characters.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= t <= 105`
