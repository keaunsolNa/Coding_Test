# 3578. Count Partitions With Max-Min Difference at Most K

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Queue, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Monotonic Queue

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to partition `nums` into one or more **non-empty** contiguous segments such that in each segment, the difference between its **maximum** and **minimum** elements is **at most** `k`.

 Return the total number of ways to partition `nums` under this condition.

 Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [9,4,1,3,7], k = 4

 **Output:** 6

 **Explanation:**

 There are 6 valid partitions where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in each segment is at most `k = 4`:

 - `[[9], [4], [1], [3], [7]]`
- `[[9], [4], [1], [3, 7]]`
- `[[9], [4], [1, 3], [7]]`
- `[[9], [4, 1], [3], [7]]`
- `[[9], [4, 1], [3, 7]]`
- `[[9], [4, 1, 3], [7]]`

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [3,3,4], k = 0

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 There are 2 valid partitions that satisfy the given conditions:

 - `[[3], [3], [4]]`
- `[[3, 3], [4]]`

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= k <= 109`
