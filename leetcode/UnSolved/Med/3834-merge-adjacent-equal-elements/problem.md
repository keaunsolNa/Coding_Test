# 3834. Merge Adjacent Equal Elements

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Stack, Simulation

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

 You must **repeatedly** apply the following merge operation until no more changes can be made:

 - If any **two adjacent elements are equal**, choose the **leftmost** such adjacent pair in the current array and replace them with a single element equal to their **sum**.

 After each merge operation, the array size **decreases** by 1. Repeat the process on the updated array until no more changes can be made.

 Return the final array after all possible merge operations.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [3,1,1,2]

 **Output:** [3,4]

 **Explanation:**

 - The middle two elements are equal and merged into `1 + 1 = 2`, resulting in `[3, 2, 2]`.
- The last two elements are equal and merged into `2 + 2 = 4`, resulting in `[3, 4]`.
- No adjacent equal elements remain. Thus, the answer is `[3, 4]`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,2,4]

 **Output:** [8]

 **Explanation:**

 - The first two elements are equal and merged into `2 + 2 = 4`, resulting in `[4, 4]`.
- The first two elements are equal and merged into `4 + 4 = 8`, resulting in `[8]`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [3,7,5]

 **Output:** [3,7,5]

 **Explanation:**

 There are no adjacent equal elements in the array, so no operations are performed.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
