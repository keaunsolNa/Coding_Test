# 3249. Count the Number of Good Nodes

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Tree, Depth-First Search

## Description

There is an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

 A node is **good** if all the subtrees rooted at its children have the same size.

 Return the number of **good** nodes in the given tree.

 A **subtree** of `treeName` is a tree consisting of a node in `treeName` and all of its descendants.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]

 **Output:** 7

 **Explanation:**

  All of the nodes of the given tree are good.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,5],[1,6],[2,7],[3,8]]

 **Output:** 6

 **Explanation:**

  There are 6 good nodes in the given tree. They are colored in the image above.

 **Example 3:**

  **Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[0,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,8],[0,9],[9,10],[9,12],[10,11]]

 **Output:** 12

 **Explanation:**

  All nodes except node 9 are good.

   

 **Constraints:**

 - `2 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
