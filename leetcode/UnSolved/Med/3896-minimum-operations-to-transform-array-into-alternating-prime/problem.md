# 3896. Minimum Operations to Transform Array into Alternating Prime

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** 

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

 An array is considered **alternating prime** if:

 - Elements at **even** indices (0-based) are **prime** numbers.
- Elements at **odd** indices are **non-prime** numbers.

 In one operation, you may **increment** any element by 1.

 Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `nums` into an **alternating prime** array.

 A **prime** number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors, 1 and itself.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - The element at index 0 must be prime. Increment `nums[0] = 1` to 2, using 1 operation.
- The element at index 1 must be non-prime. Increment `nums[1] = 2` to 4, using 2 operations.
- The element at index 2 is already prime.
- The element at index 3 is already non-prime.

 Total operations = `1 + 2 = 3`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [5,6,7,8]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 - The elements at indices 0 and 2 are already prime.
- The elements at indices 1 and 3 are already non-prime.

 No operations are needed.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [4,4]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 - The element at index 0 must be prime. Increment `nums[0] = 4` to 5, using 1 operation.
- The element at index 1 is already non-prime.

 Total operations = 1.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
