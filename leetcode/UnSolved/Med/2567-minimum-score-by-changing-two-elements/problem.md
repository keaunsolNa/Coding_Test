# 2567. Minimum Score by Changing Two Elements

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

 - The **low** score of `nums` is the **minimum** absolute difference between any two integers.
- The **high** score of `nums` is the **maximum** absolute difference between any two integers.
- The **score** of `nums` is the sum of the **high** and **low** scores.

 Return the **minimum score** after **changing two elements** of `nums`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,4,7,8,5]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - Change `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` to be 6 so that `nums` becomes [6,6,7,8,5].
- The low score is the minimum absolute difference: |6 - 6| = 0.
- The high score is the maximum absolute difference: |8 - 5| = 3.
- The sum of high and low score is 3.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,4,3]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 - Change `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` to 1 so that `nums` becomes [1,1,1].
- The sum of maximum absolute difference and minimum absolute difference is 0.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `3 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
