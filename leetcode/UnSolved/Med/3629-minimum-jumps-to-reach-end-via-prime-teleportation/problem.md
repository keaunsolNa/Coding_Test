# 3629. Minimum Jumps to Reach End via Prime Teleportation

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Math, Breadth-First Search, Number Theory

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

 You start at index 0, and your goal is to reach index `n - 1`.

 From any index `i`, you may perform one of the following operations:

 - **Adjacent Step**: Jump to index `i + 1` or `i - 1`, if the index is within bounds.
- **Prime Teleportation**: If `nums[i]` is a prime number `p`, you may instantly jump to any index `j != i` such that `nums[j] % p == 0`.

 Return the **minimum** number of jumps required to reach index `n - 1`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,2,4,6]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 One optimal sequence of jumps is:

 - Start at index `i = 0`. Take an adjacent step to index 1.
- At index `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 2` is a prime number. Therefore, we teleport to index `i = 3` as `nums[3] = 6` is divisible by 2.

 Thus, the answer is 2.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [2,3,4,7,9]

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 One optimal sequence of jumps is:

 - Start at index `i = 0`. Take an adjacent step to index `i = 1`.
- At index `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 3` is a prime number. Therefore, we teleport to index `i = 4` since `nums[4] = 9` is divisible by 3.

 Thus, the answer is 2.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [4,6,5,8]

 **Output:** 3

 **Explanation:**

 - Since no teleportation is possible, we move through `0 → 1 → 2 → 3`. Thus, the answer is 3.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= n == nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
