# 3784. Minimum Deletion Cost to Make All Characters Equal

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Hash Table, String, Enumeration

## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer array `cost` of the same length, where `cost[i]` is the cost to **delete** the `ith` character of `s`.

 You may delete any number of characters from `s` (possibly none), such that the resulting string is **non-empty** and consists of **equal** characters.

 Return an integer denoting the **minimum** total deletion cost required.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "aabaac", cost = [1,2,3,4,1,10]

 **Output:** 11

 **Explanation:**

 Deleting the characters at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 results in the string `"c"`, which consists of equal characters, and the total cost is `cost[0] + cost[1] + cost[2] + cost[3] + cost[4] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 11`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "abc", cost = [10,5,8]

 **Output:** 13

 **Explanation:**

 Deleting the characters at indices 1 and 2 results in the string `"a"`, which consists of equal characters, and the total cost is `cost[1] + cost[2] = 5 + 8 = 13`.

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** s = "zzzzz", cost = [67,67,67,67,67]

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 All characters in `s` are equal, so the deletion cost is 0.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `n == s.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= cost[i] <= 109`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
