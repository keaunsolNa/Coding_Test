# 3675. Minimum Operations to Transform String

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** String, Greedy

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters.

 You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

 - Choose any character `c` in the string and replace **every** occurrence of `c` with the **next** lowercase letter in the English alphabet.

 Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `s` into a string consisting of **only** `'a'` characters.

 **Note: **Consider the alphabet as circular, thus `'a'` comes after `'z'`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** s = "yz"

 **Output:** 2

 **Explanation:**

 - Change `'y'` to `'z'` to get `"zz"`.
- Change `'z'` to `'a'` to get `"aa"`.
- Thus, the answer is 2.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** s = "a"

 **Output:** 0

 **Explanation:**

 - The string `"a"` only consists of `'a'` characters. Thus, the answer is 0.

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
