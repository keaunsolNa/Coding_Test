# 3326. Minimum Division Operations to Make Array Non Decreasing

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** Array, Math, Greedy, Number Theory

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

 Any **positive** divisor of a natural number `x` that is **strictly less** than `x` is called a **proper divisor** of `x`. For example, 2 is a _proper divisor_ of 4, while 6 is not a _proper divisor_ of 6.

 You are allowed to perform an **operation** any number of times on `nums`, where in each **operation** you select any _one_ element from `nums` and divide it by its **greatest** **proper divisor**.

 Return the **minimum** number of **operations** required to make the array **non-decreasing**.

 If it is **not** possible to make the array _non-decreasing_ using any number of operations, return `-1`.

 

 **Example 1:**

  **Input:** nums = [25,7]

 **Output:** 1

 **Explanation:**

 Using a single operation, 25 gets divided by 5 and `nums` becomes `[5, 7]`.

  **Example 2:**

  **Input:** nums = [7,7,6]

 **Output:** -1

  **Example 3:**

  **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,1]

 **Output:** 0

  

 **Constraints:**

 - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
