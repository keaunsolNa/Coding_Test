### 문제 설명

<p>Bilbo wants to send a message to the dwarves, currently being held prisoners by the Great Goblin. He has a mechanism to get it to the dwarves, but there is a chance that the orcs may intercept the message. So he decides to encrypt the message using a very simple scheme (sucient to fool the orcs, who are not known for their IQs).</p>

<p>ically, he decides to shift the letters in every word in the message toward the right (wrapping around appropriately) by a small number. For example, shifting “oakenshield” by 3 gives him “eldoakenshi”, whereas shifting “gandalf” by 2 gives him “lfganda”. He chooses to shift every word by a different number of letters, always less than the number of letters in the word.</p>

<p>You are to write a program to help Bilbo encode his message.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line in the test data file contains the number of test cases (< 100). After that, each line contains one test case, a word, w, (provided as a String) followed by an integer, n (int). You can assume that: 0 < n < length(w).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, you are to output the word formed by shifting every letter in w to the right by n, and wrapping around to the beginning appropriately. The exact format is shown below in the examples.</p>
