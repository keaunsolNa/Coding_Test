### 문제 설명

<p>Bessie and her cow friends are playing as their favorite cow superheroes. Of course, everyone knows that any self-respecting superhero needs a signal to call them to action. Bessie has drawn a special signal on a sheet of M×N paper (1≤M≤10,1≤N≤10), but this is too small, much too small! Bessie wants to amplify the signal so it is exactly K times bigger (1≤K≤10) in each direction.</p>

<p>The signal will consist only of the '.' and 'X' characters.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains M, N, and K, separated by spaces.</p>

<p>The next M lines each contain a length-N string, collectively describing the picture of the signal.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>You should output KM lines, each with KN characters, giving a picture of the enlarged signal.</p>
