### 문제 설명

<p>Vinicius takes his fitness very seriously, and every morning at 6 a.m., rain or shine, in summer and winter, he runs in a track around a pond. Along the race track there are N equally spaced signs. To not be discouraged from exercising, Vinicius counts the number of signs he has passed and checks to see if he has run at least 10%, at least 20%, . . . , at least 90% of his training.</p>

<p>Let’s help Vinicius by calculating for him the number of signs he needs to count to have completed at least 10%, 20%, . . . , 90% of his training, given the number of laps he wants to run and the total number of signs along the track.</p>

<p>For example, suppose Vinicius wants to run 3 laps and the track has 17 signs. To ensure that he has run at least 30% of his training, he needs to count 16 signs. To guarantee at least 60%, he needs to count 31 signs.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line, which contains two integers, V and N (1 ≤ V, N ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>), where V is the desired number of laps and N is the number of signs along the track.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program must output a single line, containing nine integers, representing the numbers of signs that must be counted to ensure that at least 10%, 20%, . . . , 90% of the training has been completed, respectively.</p>
