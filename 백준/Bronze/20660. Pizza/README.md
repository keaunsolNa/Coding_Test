### 문제 설명

<p>After a long day and miserable at work, Mirko decided to order a pizza for dinner to cheer himself up. In a big pile of papers on his desk, he found a flyer of a nearby pizza restarant.</p>

<p>The restarant offers m different pizzas. Pizza toppings are labeled with positive integers. i-th pizza has k<sub>i</sub> toppings, with labels b<sub>i,1</sub>, b<sub>i,2</sub>, . . . , b<sub>i,k<sub>i</sub></sub>.</p>

<p>Mirko is very picky when it comes to food. He doesn’t like n toppings, those with labels a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, . . . , a<sub>n</sub>, so he wants to order a pizza that doesn’t contain any of those toppings. Determine the number of pizzas that Mirko can order.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of toppings, followed by n distinct integers a<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 100), the labels of toppings Mirko dislikes.</p>

<p>The second line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), the number of pizzas.</p>

<p>The following m lines describe the pizzas. The i-th line contains an integer k<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ k<sub>i</sub> ≤ 100), the numer of toppings, followed by k<sub>i</sub> distinct integers b<sub>i,j</sub> (1 ≤ b<sub>i,j</sub> ≤ 100), the labels of toppings on the i-th pizza.</p>

<p>The pizzas, i.e. the sets of toppings, will be distinct.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the number of pizzas that Mirko can order.</p>
