<p>Returning to the Beautiful Gloomy Outback (BGO) after a strenuous trip to the city, you hear a faint howl in the distance. Instantly you realize it is your friend Fenrir inviting you to a howling contest.</p>

<p>In order to make an impressive howl that wins the contest, you know that your howl must fulfill the following criteria in order to be valid:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It must consist of a combination of the letters <code>A</code>, <code>H</code>, <code>O</code> and <code>W</code>. Each letter must occur at least once.</li>
	<li>The howl can not contain two consecutive <code>W</code>’s, or two consecutive <code>H</code>’s.</li>

	<li>There can never be an <code>A</code> after the first occurrence of an <code>O</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you produce a longer howl than Fenrir and win the contest?</p>
