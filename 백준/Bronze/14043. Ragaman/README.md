### 문제 설명

<p>An anagram of a string is formed by rearranging the letters in the string. For example, the anagrams of aab are aab, aba, and baa.</p>

<p>A wildcard anagram of a string is an anagram of the string where some of the letters might have been replaced with an asterisk (*). For example, two possible wildcard anagrams of aab are *ab and *b*.</p>

<p>Given two strings, determine whether the second string is a wildcard anagram of the first string.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The two lines of input will both consist of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) characters. Each character in the first line will be a lowercase letter. Each character in the second line will be either a lowercase letter or an asterisk.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the character A if the string on the second line is a wildcard anagram of the string on the first line. Otherwise, output the character N.</p>
