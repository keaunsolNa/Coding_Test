### 문제 설명

<p>On a whiteboard, you have found a list of integers. Is it possible to use all of them to write down a correct arithmetic expression where one of them is the sum of all the others?</p>

<p>You may not alter the integers in any way (<em>e.g.</em>, changing the sign or concatenating).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^4$), representing the number of integers on the whiteboard.</p>

<p>The integers on the whiteboard are given over the next $n$ lines, one per line. Their absolute values are guaranteed to be at most $10^5$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print a single integer $x$ which is one of the inputs, and is the sum of all the others. If there’s more than one such $x$, output any one. If there are no such values of $x$, output the string ‘<code>BAD</code>’.</p>
