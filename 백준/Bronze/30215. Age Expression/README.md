### 문제 설명

<p>Dr. O has two granddaughters (named Alyssa and Konari) and they keep Dr. O young!</p>

<p>When people ask Dr. O how old he is, rather than giving one positive integer (his age), Dr. O provides two positive integers a and k; Dr. O’s age can then be computed using the expression (a × Alyssa’s age) + (k × Konari’s age).</p>

<p>Given three positive integers (Dr. O’s age, Alyssa’s age, and Konari’s age), determine if the positive integers a and k exist.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>There is only one input line; it provides (respectively) Dr. O’s age, Alyssa’s age, and Konari’s age. Assume that 1 ≤ Konari’s age < Alyssa’s age < Dr. O’s age ≤ 150.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print 1 (one) if a and k exist, 0 (zero) otherwise. Note that a and k must both be greater than zero.</p>
