### 문제 설명

<p>You want to boil eggs for breakfast. You have n eggs and a pot. It takes 15 minutes to boil a pot of eggs (no matter the number of eggs). It is risky to put more than P eggs in the pot and the pot can carry at most Q grams of eggs. Now you are given the weight of the eggs in grams, and you have exactly 15 minutes in hand.</p>

<p>Write a program to find the maximum number of eggs that you can boil without taking any risk.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input will contain T (≤ 100) denoting the number of cases. Each case starts with 3 integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), P (1 ≤ P ≤ 30) and Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 100). The next line contains n positive integers (not greater than 10). These integers denote the weight of the eggs in grams.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each case, print the case number and the desired result.</p>
