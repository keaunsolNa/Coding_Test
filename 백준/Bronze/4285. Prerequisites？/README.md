### 문제 설명

<p>Freddie the frosh has chosen to take k courses. To meet the degree requirements, he must take courses from each of several categories. Can you assure Freddie that he will graduate, based on his course selection?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of several test cases. For each case, the first line of input contains 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, the number of courses Freddie has chosen, and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, the number of categories. One or more lines follow containing k 4-digit integers follow; each is the number of a course selected by Freddie. Each category is represented by a line containing 1 ≤ c ≤ 100, the number of courses in the category, 0 ≤ r ≤ c, the minimum number of courses from the category that must be taken, and the c course numbers in the category. Each course number is a 4-digit integer. The same course may fulfil several category requirements. Freddie's selections, and the course numbers in any particular category, are distinct. A line containing 0 follows the last test case.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output a line containing "yes" if Freddie's course selection meets the degree requirements; otherwise output "no."</p>
