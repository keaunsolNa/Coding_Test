### 문제 설명

<p>Usually, in programming contests the problem statement tells you what to do. We find that boring.</p>

<p>In this task we do the opposite. We will tell you something you must not do:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">You must not sort the given sequence.</p>

<p>Given is a sequence S of distinct integers. Rearrange the sequence in any way. The only condition is that the resulting sequence must not be sorted – neither in ascending nor in descending order.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input file contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank line.</p>

<p>Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a number N (between 3 and 1000, inclusive) giving the length of the sequence. The second line contains N space separated numbers that form the sequence. No two of these N numbers are equal, and all of these numbers fit into a 32-bit signed integer variable.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output format is the same as the input format, with one exception: The whitespaces may be arbitrary. Just make sure that every two tokens in the output are separated by at least one whitespace.</p>

<p>Each sequence in the output must contain the same numbers as the corresponding input sequence, and they must not be in sorted order.</p>
