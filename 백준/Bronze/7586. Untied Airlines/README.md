### 문제 설명

<p>An airline called Untied, has had a series of bad press articles. The flying public are not impressed. So Untied has decided to award upgrades on future flights if a passenger suffers certain elements of poor service.</p>

<p>The poor service includes things like lost luggage, the stewardess swiping a passenger in the face as she reaches past them, or cancelling flights at short notice and not offering alternative flights in time for connections.</p>

<p>These elements of poor service are encoded and each is awarded points. If a passenger collects 200 such points on one flight, then their next flight is automatically upgraded. The poor service codes and associated points are shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Your job is to tell Untied for each flight, how many upgrades are awarded.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of a series of flights, each beginning with a flight number. Input is terminated by a flight number which is just a single # - do not process this flight.</p>

<p>The flight number starts with UT, in upper case, followed by a sequence of up to 4 digits (eg: UT525). Each line after the flight number begins with a seat number (a 2 digit number followed by a single letter eg: 25H means seat H in row 25). The seat number is followed by a space and then one of the letter codes, always upper case. The seat letter will be in the range A to J.</p>

<p>The last seat number for a flight is 00A, which does not correspond to a valid seat. Do not process this seat.</p>

<p>Table of codes and points awarded</p>
