### 문제 설명

<p>Given a list of numbers, we define a sublist as one or more consecutive elements in the list. An increasing sublist is when the consecutive elements are in strictly increasing order, i.e., each element is greater than the element to its left in the sublist (except the first element in the sublist which does not have an element to its left).</p>

<p>Given a list, find the length (number of elements) of the longest increasing sublist, i.e., the length of the sublist with the most number of elements.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first input line contains an integer, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), indicating the number of elements in the list. The next input line provides the n elements in the list. Assume each element is between 1 and 100, inclusive.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print the length (number of elements) of the longest increasing sublist.</p>
