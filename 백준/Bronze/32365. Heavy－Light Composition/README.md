### 문제 설명

<p>In a string containing only lowercase letters of the alphabet (“a” through “z”), we say a letter is heavy if it appears more than once in the string, and light otherwise.</p>

<p>We will be given a number of strings. For each string, we would like to determine whether the letters of the string alternate between light and heavy.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input will consist of two positive integers T and N, representing the number of strings and the length of each string.</p>

<p>The next T lines each contain a sequence of N lowercase letters of the alphabet.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output T lines, where each line will be either <code>T</code> or <code>F</code>. If the i-th input string does alternate between light and heavy letters, the i-th line of output should be <code>T</code>; and otherwise, the i-th line of output should be <code>F</code>.</p>
