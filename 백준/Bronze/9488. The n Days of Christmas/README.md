### 문제 설명

<blockquote>
<p>On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, a partridge in a pear tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great. I wanted an iPad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, now I have 4 birds: two turtle doves and a partridge today, and a partridge from yesterday. My cats are going crazy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the third day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, three french hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's with the birds? I now have ten of them, and no place to put them (except insidethe cats). How long can my true love keep this up?</p>

<p>Given a number of days of Christmas, figure out the total number of gifts I'm going to receive.</p>
