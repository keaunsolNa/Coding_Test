### 문제 설명

<p>The king pays his loyal knight in gold coins. On the first day of his service, the knight receives one gold coin. On each of the next two days (the second and third days of service), the knight receives two gold coins. On each of the next three days (the fourth, fifth, and sixth days of service), the knight receives three gold coins. On each of the next four days (the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth days of service), the knight receives four gold coins. This pattern of payments will continue indefinitely: after receiving <em>N</em> gold coins on each of <em>N</em> consecutive days, the knight will receive <em>N</em>+1 gold coins on each of the next <em>N</em>+1 consecutive days, where <em>N</em> is any positive integer.</p>

<p>Your program will determine the total number of gold coins paid to the knight in any given number of days (starting from Day 1).</p>
