### 문제 설명

<p>Dusa eats Yobis, but only Yobis of a certain size.</p>

<p>If Dusa encounters a Yobi that is smaller than itself, it eats the Yobi, and absorbs its size. For example, if Dusa is of size 10 and it encounters a Yobi of size 6, Dusa eats the Yobi and expands to size 10 + 6 = 16.</p>

<p>If Dusa encounters a Yobi that is the same size as itself or larger, Dusa runs away without eating the Yobi.</p>

<p>Dusa is currently facing a line of Yobis and will encounter them in order. Dusa is guaranteed to eventually encounter a Yobi that causes it to run away. Your job is to determine Dusa’s size when this happens.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the positive integer, R, which is Dusa’s size when it eventually runs away.</p>
