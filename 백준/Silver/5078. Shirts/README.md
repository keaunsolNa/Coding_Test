### 문제 설명

<p>Jane and Tim are getting married. They are so compatible because they keep their shirts in their wardrobes in the same colour and size order. Jane has bought her own house so Tim will be moving in after they are married. His shirts will need to be merged in with hers, sorted by size then colour.</p>
