### 문제 설명

<p>Cows are remarkably bad dancers.  Nonetheless, Farmer John has discovered that graceful cows tend to produce more milk and therefore has enrolled his entire herd cows in a ballroom dance class.  In the first class meeting, the N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000) boy cows (a.k.a. bulls) and N girl cows in the herd must first be paired up into couples.  Two cows make a good couple if they have relatively similar heights (i.e., the difference of their heights is small).  Given the heights of all the cows, your task is to find a pairing-up of the cows that minimizes the total sum of all height differences over all couples.</p>
