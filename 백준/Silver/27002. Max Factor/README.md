### 문제 설명

<p>To improve the organization of his farm, Farmer John labels each of his N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5,000) cows with a distinct serial number in the range 1..20,000. Unfortunately, he is unaware that the cows interpret some serial numbers as better than others. In particular, a cow whose serial number has the highest prime factor enjoys the highest social standing among all the other cows.</p>

<p>(Recall that a prime number is just a number that has no divisors except for 1 and itself. The number 7 is prime while the number 6, being divisible by 2 and 3, is not).</p>

<p>Given a set of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5,000) serial numbers in the range 1..20,000, determine the one that has the largest prime factor.</p>
