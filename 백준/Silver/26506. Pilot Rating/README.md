### 문제 설명

<p>The Resistance is assigning pilots to new two-person X-wing Starfighters. General Leia has assigned you the task of putting teams together for the Red Squadron. Every pilot must be placed on exactly one 2- person team, and there are an even number of pilots. However, you would like to maintain a high skill level for each team by making sure that each of the teams has some minimum total rating. We define the total rating of a team to be the sum of the ratings of both pilots on the team.</p>

<p>You must determine the maximum value, X, such that you can form teams, each of which have a total rating greater than or equal to X.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>, n is even), the number of pilots who volunteered for Red Squadron. Each of the following n lines contains one single integer s<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ s<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>), the rating of pilot i.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print, on a single line, the maximum value, X, such that you can form teams where every team has a total rating greater than or equal to X.</p>
