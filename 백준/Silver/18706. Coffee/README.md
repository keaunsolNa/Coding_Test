### 문제 설명

<p>Given the prices of different types of coffee (latte, cappuccino, · · ·) for each size (small, medium, and large), and a list of orders of a group of persons. Your task is to find how much will each person pay eventually. The cost that a person needs to pay is the cost of coffee he/she ordered in addition to the delivery fees. The delivery fees for each person are 100<span>$</span> divided by the number of persons (rounded down).</p>

<p>Eventually, the final cost should ignore 1<span>$</span> greater or less than what should be paid to the nearest multiple of 5 (i.e 44<span>$</span> and 46<span>$</span> will be rounded to 45<span>$</span>. However, 47<span>$</span> and 48<span>$</span> will not be changed).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains a single integer T specifying the number of test cases.</p>

<p>Each test case begins with a line containing two integers C and P (1 ≤ C, P ≤ 100), in which C is the number of different types of coffees, and P is the number of unique persons.</p>

<p>Then C lines follow, giving the coffee types. Each line contains a string N and three integers S, M, and L (1 ≤ S, M, L ≤ 100), in which N is a coffee name, S, M, and L are the prices for small, medium, and large sizes, respectively. Each coffee type will appear exactly once per test case.</p>

<p>Then P lines follow, giving the list of orders. Each line contains three strings X, Y , and Z, in which X is a person name, Y is the coffee size (Y ∈ {small, medium, large}), and Z is a coffee name. It is guaranteed that all the given P names are distinct, and each person will order coffee type that exists.</p>

<p>Both the coffee and person names are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters with a length of no more than 15 letter.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print P lines in which each line contains two space-separated values, the name of the person and the total cost he/she will pay for his/her order. Print the persons in the same order as given in the input.</p>
