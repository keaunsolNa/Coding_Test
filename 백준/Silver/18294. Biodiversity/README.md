### 문제 설명

<p>Alicia has a huge garden which is the habitat of many animals that she really cares about. After listening to a podcast about biodiversity, she becomes very concerned about the balance between species in her garden. She wants to know if there is a species that could overtake the others. In order to do so, she decides to carry out a census of all animals in the garden, writing down the species of each of them. Can you help her checking if there is strictly more animals from one species than the animals from all others species together?</p>

### 입력

<ul>
	<li>on the first line: an integer N;</li>
	<li>on each of the next N lines: the species of an animal as a string of length at most 20, containing only ASCII alphanumeric characters.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>A string that appears a number of times that is greater than the sum of the others, if there is any, or the string “NONE” otherwise.</p>
